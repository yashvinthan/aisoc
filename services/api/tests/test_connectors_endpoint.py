"""Unit tests for the connectors API proxy helpers.

Full end-to-end CRUD tests would need a Postgres fixture and the auth
stack wired up, which the rest of this test suite generally skips. The
parts that *are* worth covering in isolation are the inter-service
proxy helpers — they hold the catalog validation and error mapping
logic that the wizard depends on, and they fail in subtle ways when the
connectors microservice misbehaves.

We mock ``httpx.AsyncClient`` directly because:

* It's the seam between this service and the connectors microservice;
  pinning it in tests is enough to characterise our behaviour without
  pulling up a second FastAPI app.
* The error-mapping logic (503 / 502 / 422 passthrough) only has
  meaningful assertions when we can synthesise specific upstream
  status codes.
