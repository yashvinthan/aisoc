## World-Class Hardening Program (2026-07, in flight)

A proof-first, security-first program to make every README claim gate-backed, close four existential agent-security holes, and build the ingest-time-graph + multi-model-router moat. Executed one phase per PR with a mandatory CI gate each. Committed status is the checklist below (per-session working detail is tracked locally in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`, which is gitignored per repo convention). Baseline audit: [`docs/audit/REALITY_REPORT.md`](docs/audit/REALITY_REPORT.md) and [`docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md`](docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md).

- [x] Phase 0 — Reality audit (claim-to-gate matrix, ranked overclaims/untested-paths/circular-gates)
- [x] Phase 1 — Four existential holes (prompt injection, memory poisoning, cross-store tenant isolation, data-exfiltration/redaction, cost DoS, vault)
- [x] Phase 2 — Supply chain + truth (security.yml scanners, claim-gate ratchet, hard-fail insecure prod defaults, TRADEMARK, verifying-releases, license fix; continuation landed: per-image cosign signatures + CycloneDX SBOM attestations + SLSA provenance, all actions SHA-pinned)
- [x] Phase 3 — Integration / E2E / chaos / DR (real-container spine test, backup-restore, chaos, upgrade, cross-store isolation live-replay; heavy-demo-stack Playwright E2E + demo-timing gate tracked as non-blocking 3.5+)
- [ ] Phase 4 — Real evals + detection content truth table (third-party-labeled corpus, hallucination/calibration/abstention, model matrix) — **4a/4b landed** (de-circularised DAC candidate-rule gate + honest executable-vs-imported truth table); 4c+ live-agent eval / calibration / model matrix pending
- [x] Phase 5 — Data spine correctness (versioned event-schema registry + dead-letter queue + source-event lineage in the fusion consumer; idempotency via AlertSink dedup + event-time watermarking; backfill/replay-from-offset tracked as 5b)
- [x] Phase 6 — Performance + cost (fusion hot-path throughput harness with a generous regression-floor gate; deterministic storage $/TB cost model + drift gate; storage-consolidation ADR-0005)
- [x] Phase 7 — Ingest-time graph + multi-model router — **graph-at-ingest already shipped** (v8 T1.1, `services/ingest/internal/graph/`); **7a landed**: unified deterministic→ML→LLM router with tier attribution + the `AISOC_DETERMINISTIC` determinism contract (`services/agents/app/routing/model_router.py`, gated). 7b+ (posture collection, effective-permissions snapshot loader, bi-temporal valid_from/valid_to, fusion-time ContextBundle) tracked in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`
- [x] Phase 8 — LLMOps (version+hash-pinned prompt registry with a CI drift gate; model pins + deterministic-terminated provider-fallback chains; content-addressed response cache; fail-closed structured-output validation)
- [x] Phase 9 — Autonomy safety (dry-run-by-default policy, honest bounded rollback-capability contract replacing silent `return True`, mandatory post-action verification for unattended containment, break-glass HIGH-blast flag, autonomy scorecard — all gated at the policy layer; live-router wiring + durable approval-SLA timer table tracked as 9b)
- [x] Phase 10 — Connector + content quality (runtime-contract conformance suite across all 69 connectors — gates the "live Test connection" capability that had NO gate + secret-field-marking; published `conformance-matrix.md` with a drift gate; detection lifecycle already gated by Phase 4a DAC + Phase 4b truth table. Live-vendor sandbox smoke + rate-limit/checkpoint durability tracked as 10b)
- [x] Phase 11 — API / SDK / release engineering (pure-Python OpenAPI breaking-change detector `scripts/openapi_diff.py` + `openapi-breaking.yml` gate: PR spec vs base fails on removed endpoint/schema/field, type change, tightened request, or dropped enum value — closes the OpenAPI NO GATE row; per-language SDK generated-client contract-drift tracked as 11b)
- [x] Phase 12 — Observability + governance (per-service SLOs in `docs/operations/slos.yaml` with a coverage gate; `docs/operations/observability.md` documenting the four golden signals + single OTel trace across the spine; `GOVERNANCE.md` +  + DCO sign-off in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; governance-completeness gate — `governance.yml`)

**Program status:** all 13 hardening phases (0–12) are landed. Building on them, the **Fully-Operational AI-SOC roadmap** (Phases A1–E1) is now complete — it wired the three end-to-end paths the reality audit found unwired and pushed the platform to competitive parity + beyond:

- **Phase A (SIEM foundation):** A1 ClickHouse lake writer · A2 live detection-evaluation worker (825 executable rules on the stream) · A3 default-on one-command deploy (connectors + graph on) · A4 UEBA behavioral-model fusion.
- **Phase B (SOAR foundation):** B1 auto-triage worker (copilot default) · B2 credential resolver + `decide()`-governed live dispatch + 10 vendor adapters · B3 real rollback + post-action verification + durable approval-SLA timers · B4 Business Context Rules in the hot path.
- **Phase C (parity differentiators):** C1 Advanced Data Explorer · C2 Effective-Permissions live posture loader · C3 autopilot/copilot posture scorecard · C4 fuse-time attack-chain auto-grouping.
- **Phase D (breadth):** D1 eight connectors (QRadar/Exabeam/Securonix/Devo/Netskope/Windows-Sysmon/Zeek-Suricata/syslog-CEF) · D2 AI/LLM-usage audit connector + `llm-*` detections + hot/cold lake tiering · D3 live-vendor mock-server smoke.
- **Phase E (prove it):** E1 CI-gated benchmark scoreboard tied to a deterministic live-agent MITRE-accuracy run.

The claim-to-gate matrix stands at **33 GATED / 7 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE** — **every product claim is now backed by a failing test** and the ratchet (`MAX_NO_GATE=0`) forbids any regression. The 7 remaining PARTIAL rows are honest, named deferrals to phases outside the A–E scope. Per-session working detail is tracked locally in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.

## v7.0.x — Endpoint telemetry wave + hardening (2026-05-10)

Six-PR feature wave that closes [#44](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/issues/44)
("osctrl connector for fleet-wide osquery telemetry") and significantly extends
osquery coverage end to end. All six PRs were implemented sequentially as part of
the v7.0 release window and then patched through 7.0.1 → 7.0.3.

### Endpoint telemetry — osquery feature wave (PR1–PR6)

- [x] **PR1 — osctrl + FleetDM connectors** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/osctrl.py`,
      `fleetdm.py`). Schema-driven setup, live `Test connection` round-trip, secrets
      encrypted via `CredentialVault`, polling on per-instance schedule, plus marketplace
      manifests at `plugins/osctrl/plugin.yaml` and `plugins/fleetdm/plugin.yaml`.
- [x] **PR2 — Native osquery detection schema migration** — 16 osquery rules
      (`detections/endpoint/osquery-*.yaml`, IDs `det-endpoint-281..296`) migrated from
      `_quarantine/` to the native schema, with positive/negative test fixtures
      (`detections/fixtures/osquery_*.json`) gated by the Detection Validation workflow.
- [x] **PR3 — Live-query playbook step** (`services/actions/app/clients/osctrl_client.py`,
      `fleetdm_client.py`, `osquery_allowlist.py`, `services/agents/app/playbook/steps/osquery_live_query.py`).
      Allowlisted distributed queries pushed to single hosts or fleet-wide via
      osctrl/FleetDM with HMAC-signed ChatOps approval.
- [x] **PR4 — `aisoc-osquery-tls` FastAPI service + `aisoc-direct` agent connector**
      (`services/osquery-tls/`, `services/connectors/app/connectors/aisoc_direct.py`).
      First-party self-hosted osquery TLS plugin, FleetDM-compatible config/log endpoints,
      direct-from-agent ingest path that bypasses third-party SaaS.
- [x] **PR5 — Osquery packs + FIM endpoint + FIM dashboard**
      (`services/osquery-tls/app/api/v1/endpoints/fim.py`, `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/FimDashboard.tsx`).
      Bundled IR / OSquery-ATT&CK / FIM packs; ingests `file_events` and synthesises
      alerts on writes to `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, sshd configs, sudoers, Windows
      registry hives. FIM-specific detection IDs `det-endpoint-297..300`.
- [x] **PR6 — AiSOC osquery extensions** (`services/osquery-extensions/tables/*.go`).
      5 custom Go-based virtual tables: `aisoc_browser_extensions`, `aisoc_kernel_modules`,
      `aisoc_attck_persistence`, `aisoc_pending_actions`, `aisoc_alert_cache` — ship
      richer endpoint visibility plus a bidirectional response channel.

### Patch releases

#### v7.0.1 — Web app hardening (CodeQL + Turbopack)

- [x] **42 CodeQL code-scanning alerts cleared** (`py/unused-global-variable`,
      `py/cyclic-import`, `py/empty-except`, `py/log-injection`,
      `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`, `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`,
      `py/stack-trace-exposure`, `py/call/wrong-arguments`, `py/unused-import`,
      `js/unused-local-variable`).
- [x] **`apps/web/next.config.js`** — Removed deprecated `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds`
      key Next.js 16 no longer accepts; added `turbopack.root` for workspace package
      resolution.
- [x] **`apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`** — Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>`
      so the render-blocking `themeBootstrapScript` can write `data-theme` /
      `data-theme-preference` / `style.colorScheme` without React reporting an
      attribute mismatch.

#### v7.0.2 — Version alignment + landing-page footer + docs

- [x] **`apps/web/package.json`** bumped to `7.0.2`; sidebar shows `v7.0.2` dynamically.
- [x] **`apps/web/src/components/landing/Footer.tsx`** — Replaced hard-coded `v6.1.0`
      with a dynamic import of `package.json`.
- [x] **`README.md`** — Added `osquery-tls` (port 8090) and `osquery-extensions` to the
      services / Swagger / directory-tree / dev-surface tables.

#### v7.0.3 — Structural hydration fix + font preload

- [x] **`apps/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`** — Wrapped `<DemoBanner />` in
      a new `<ClientOnly>` boundary so the banner (which reads
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE`) is never server-rendered. Eliminates React
      hydration error #418 caused by stale env-var inlining producing a structural
      tree mismatch (server saw `<button>` from `Sidebar`, client expected `<div>`
      from `DemoBanner`).
- [x] **`apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`** — Added `preload: false` to the
      `JetBrains_Mono` `next/font/google` config; eliminates "preloaded but not
      used within a few seconds" Chrome warnings without any visible FOUT.

## v7.1.0 — Shipped ✅ (2026-05-10) — Cloud Security Coverage Wave

Six new connectors, three documentation backfills, and a new ingest template
closing the biggest cloud-security gap in the connector catalogue. Every Tier-1
cloud workload protection platform now has a first-class AiSOC integration,
AWS gets three native data sources, and Kubernetes audit logs land via a
dual-mode connector that works on both managed and air-gapped clusters.

### Track A — Documentation backfill for existing cloud connectors

- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/wiz.md`** — Service-account creation,
      `read:issues` + `read:vulnerabilities` scopes, token rotation, normalised
      severity map, worked Wiz `Issue` → inbox event example.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/aws-security-hub.md`** — IAM-role vs.
      static-key auth, `securityhub:GetFindings` permission, and the
      `BLOCK_IP`/`ALLOW_IP` capability documented end-to-end against
      `services/actions/app/clients/aws_security_groups.py`.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/lacework.md`** — API-token flow, `api_url`
      regional variants, alert → event severity collapse.
- [x] **`apps/docs/sidebars.ts`** — All three backfilled pages + the four new
      Track B–D pages registered under the `Connectors` category.

### Track B — New CNAPP connectors

- [x] **`PrismaCloudConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/prisma_cloud.py`)
      — Full CSPM/CWPP coverage. JWT auth via `POST /login`, paginated
      `GET /alert/v1/alert` with windowed `time.from`/`time.to`, severity collapse,
      `compute_url` override for self-hosted Compute Edition.
- [x] **`OrcaConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/orca.py`) —
      `https://api.orcasecurity.io/api/alerts` with `api_token` auth, severity
      collapse with Orca-specific `hazardous → high` rule.
- [x] Manifests at `plugins/prisma-cloud/plugin.yaml` and `plugins/orca/plugin.yaml`,
      docs at `apps/docs/docs/connectors/{prisma-cloud,orca}.md`, full test
      suites under `services/connectors/tests/test_{prisma_cloud,orca}.py`.

### Track C — Native AWS connectors

- [x] **`AWSGuardDutyConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_guardduty.py`)
      — boto3-based, supports IAM-role + static-key auth via `_resolve_session`,
      iterates detectors with `list_findings` + `get_findings`. Collapses
      GuardDuty's continuous numeric severity scale (`0.1`–`10.0`) into AiSOC's
      four-tier `info|low|medium|high` ladder.
- [x] **`AWSCloudTrailConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_cloudtrail.py`)
      — `cloudtrail.lookup_events` with a curated 21-event allow-list covering
      identity abuse, persistence, data-plane abuse, network exposure, and trail
      tampering. Allow-list overridable via the `event_names` field.
- [x] **`AWSVPCFlowLogsConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_vpc_flow.py`)
      — `cloudwatch_logs.filter_log_events`, v2 + v5 format parsing,
      RFC-5735-aware public-IP heuristic, default `?REJECT` filter pattern,
      severity heuristic (`public REJECT → medium`, `internal REJECT → low`,
      `ACCEPT → info`).
- [x] Manifests + docs + tests for all three connectors. 27 unit tests for
      `AWSVPCFlowLogsConnector` covering v2/v5 parsing and public-IP edge cases.

### Track D — Kubernetes audit logs (dual-mode)

- [x] **`KubernetesAuditConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/kubernetes_audit.py`)
      ships with two delivery modes selected via the `mode` config field:
      - **`webhook` (recommended)** — apiserver pushes audit events to AiSOC's
        new dedicated `POST /v1/ingest/k8s-audit/{tenant_id}` route,
        authenticated with a shared secret in the `X-AiSOC-K8s-Token` header
        (constant-time compared so a partial-prefix attacker can't shave
        bytes off via timing). Legacy `/v1/inbox/{token}` path with the
        `k8s-audit` template is kept as a fallback for control planes that
        cannot inject custom headers into the audit-webhook kubeconfig.
      - **`file_tail`** — AiSOC's connector pod tails a local `audit.log` using
        a byte-position cursor (atomically written via `os.replace` to a
        `.aisoc-cursor` sidecar) with rotation/truncation detection and a hard
        per-poll byte cap so a backlog can't blow up a single poll cycle.
- [x] **`services/ingest/internal/handler/k8s_audit.go`** — Dedicated Go
      handler for the webhook route. Caps body size via
      `K8S_AUDIT_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (default 16 MiB), rejects oversized batches
      with `413` so the apiserver shrinks `--audit-webhook-batch-max-size`
      and retries, and publishes each `EventList.items[]` entry through the
      existing normalizer + Kafka publisher using
      `connector_type: kubernetes_audit`. The route is disabled (returns
      `503`) until an operator sets `K8S_AUDIT_SHARED_SECRET`, so a fresh
      install never accidentally accepts unauthenticated audit traffic.
- [x] **`kubernetes_audit` normalizer profile**
      (`services/ingest/internal/normalizer/normalizer.go`) — Maps `auditID`
      to `external_id`, `verb` to `activity_name`, `user.username` to
      `actor.user.name`, `objectRef.{namespace,resource,name}` to a
      composite `target.resource.name`, and translates the connector's
      string severity (`critical|high|medium|low|info`) into OCSF integer
      severities (5/4/3/2/1).
- [x] **`k8s-audit` inbox template**
      (`services/ingest/internal/normalizer/templates/k8s-audit.yaml`) —
      maps apiserver `Event` payloads onto AiSOC's normalised event shape
      for the legacy inbox-token path; severity is derived in the
      connector's `_classify_severity` heuristic so the same logic applies
      to both delivery modes.
- [x] **Severity heuristic** — `exec`/`attach`/`portforward` on Pod and
      `create` on `ClusterRoleBinding` → `high`; writes to `Secret`/`ConfigMap`/
      `ClusterRole`/`Role` → `medium`; successful reads on sensitive resources
      → `low`; everything else → `info`.
- [x] **`plugins/kubernetes-audit/plugin.yaml`** — 4-field config schema
      (`mode`, `cluster_name`, `inbox_token`, `audit_log_path`, `cursor_path`),
      `category: cloud`, capabilities `pull_audit` + `pull_alerts`.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/kubernetes-audit.md`** — Sample `AuditPolicy`
      + sample `AuditSink` for both managed and self-hosted clusters.

### Cross-cutting

- [x] **`pnpm marketplace:sync`** — `marketplace/index.json` +
      `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json` rebuilt; plugin count rose
      `43 → 49`. Total: `total=7104 detections=6993 playbooks=62 plugins=49
      mitre_techniques=493`.
- [x] **`apps/web/package.json`** bumped to `7.1.0`; sidebar and landing-page
      footer surface the new version dynamically.

## v7.2.0 — Shipped ✅ (2026-05-13) — Stage-2 Connector + Surface Wave (`feat/wazuh-connector`)

Eight-commit feature wave broadening connector reach (Wazuh + auditd), making
the response-action layer vendor-pluggable, replacing the NL→query template
fallback with a deterministic translator, closing the threat-intel write loop
to MISP, adding a blameless case post-mortem surface, and standing up a GCP
Terraform skeleton equivalent to the existing AWS module.

### Connectors

- [x] **`WazuhConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/wazuh.py`)
      — polls the Wazuh Indexer `wazuh-alerts-*` indices over HTTPX with
      basic-auth, paginates time-windowed queries, retries on 5xx with
      capped backoff, and normalises severity into the four-tier ladder.
      Marketplace manifest + per-connector docs + 24 unit tests.
- [x] **`AuditdConnector`** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/auditd.py`)
      — file-tail of `/var/log/audit/audit.log` with multi-record
      reassembly by msg id, hex `proctitle`/`argv` decode, and
      `(inode, byte_offset)` cursor for log rotation. Ships with
      `profiles/auditd/aisoc.rules` opinionated auditctl ruleset whose
      `-k` keys map 1:1 to detection rules; 4 new detection rules pivot
      off `auditd_key` for sudoers / SSH / kernel-module / systemd
      tampering. 444-test full connectors suite green (excluding
      `test_scheduler.py` which needs the `apscheduler` dev dep).
- [x] Connector registry now declares **83 first-party connectors**;
      `pnpm marketplace:sync` rebuilt `marketplace/index.json` +
      `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`.

### CLI

- [x] **`aisoc plugin new <NAME> --type {enricher|connector|responder|detection|widget}`**
      replaces the old hard-coded `plugin scaffold` with per-type templates
      shipped inside the `aisoc-cli` wheel via `importlib.resources`.
      `string.Template` substitution for `${slug}`, `${name}`, `${author}`;
      tests parameterised across all five plugin types asserting manifest
      validation and zero placeholder leakage. `aisoc plugin scaffold`
      retained as alias.

### Live Actions

- [x] **Generic `(vendor_id, capability)` dispatcher**
      (`services/actions/app/live_actions/`) — pluggable
      `LiveActionExecutor` ABC + module-level registry + dispatcher with
      structured logging and error translation. Unknown pairs return
      `LiveActionResult(status=FAILED, error="executor_not_found")` so the
      agent degrades gracefully. Adapters wrap CrowdStrike, Okta,
      AWS SG, Splunk so they show up as `builtin` descriptors.
- [x] **`/api/v1/live-actions`** — `discover`, `dispatch`, `dry-run`. Honours
      `dry_run` + missing-credentials → `SIMULATED`, never `PARTIAL`.
- [x] 45 new tests across models / registry / dispatcher / router / builtins
      (full actions suite: 99 passed).
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md`** + sidebar entry.

### Agents

- [x] **Deterministic NL→ES|QL translator**
      (`services/agents/app/nl_query/`) — IR + grammar validator + renderers
      for ES|QL / KQL / SPL. Replaces every `# TODO: translate` comment in
      `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/nl_query.py`. Optional
      `enhance_with_llm` (`gpt-4o-mini`) path with deterministic fallback
      so the air-gapped story keeps working.
- [x] **50-pair NL→ES|QL eval set**
      (`services/agents/tests/eval_data/nl_query_eval.json`) +
      `test_nl_query_eval.py` harness — 100% syntactic validity, 100%
      semantic match (50/50 perfect) against gold intents.

### API surfaces

- [x] **Blameless case post-mortem** —
      `GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/postmortem?format=json|html`. Pure
      builder + async DB orchestrator
      (`services/api/app/services/case_postmortem.py`) reusing the
      `case_summary` fetchers; HTML renderer with inline CSS, defensive
      escaping, no external assets. Tests assert XSS escaping,
      deterministic ordering, and explicit blamelessness (analyst handles
      must not surface in the narrative; assignee header line is
      explicitly allow-listed).
- [x] **STIX → MISP push** (Stage 3 #20) — closes the threat-intel write
      loop. `POST /stix/indicators` and `POST /stix/bundles` accept
      `?push_to_misp=true` and return a structured `misp` block on the same
      response. `GET /stix/misp/health` and `POST /stix/misp/dry-run`
      added for operator verification + air-gap audits. Pure mappers
      cover `ipv4`/`ipv6`, `domain-name`, `url`, `email-addr`,
      `file:hashes` (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512) and `file:name`. Push
      failures are non-fatal: AiSOC store remains source of truth, MISP is
      best-effort. Reuses the existing `enforce_airgap_for_url` chokepoint.
      76 new tests.

### Infrastructure

- [x] **`infra/terraform/gcp/`** — Cloud Run for `api`/`web`/`ingest`,
      Cloud SQL Postgres 16 + Memorystore Redis 7.2 on private IPs through
      a dedicated VPC + Serverless VPC Access connector, Secret Manager
      for every credential, Artifact Registry for images, one service
      account per Cloud Run service with least-privilege `secretAccessor`
      bindings. Skeleton points at the public GHCR demo images so a fresh
      `apply` works zero-config. `apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md` +
      sidebar slot between `kubernetes` and `env-vars`.

### Documentation

- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/operations/notifications.md`** — complete inventory
      of every notification surface in AiSOC (Web Push, Slack/Teams
      ChatOps, playbook `notify_slack`, `create_ticket` simulation,
      honeytoken first-touch webhooks, connector freshness alerts, on-call
      gating, suppression / quiet-hours, per-mechanism testing recipe).
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/plugins/lifecycle.md`** — operator's view of plugin
      states, trust modes (`strict | warn | disabled`), filesystem + OCI
      discovery, the full operator REST API with required permissions,
      configuration reference, upgrade/rollback semantics, and the
      structlog events worth alerting on.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md`** — operator doc with
      config, endpoints, the STIX→MISP type table, failure modes, and the
      dry-run-as-air-gap-proof workflow.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md`** — covers both
      `/summary` and `/postmortem` with audience, output, automation, and
      runbook archive guidance. Cases summary breadcrumb now points
      operators at both endpoints.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/{wazuh,auditd}.md`** + per-connector
      sidebar entries.
- [x] **`apps/docs/docs/plugins/cli.md`** — documents the new `aisoc
      plugin new --type` surface.
- [x] **`apps/docs/sidebars.ts`** — every new page registered in the
      correct category (Connectors, Plugin SDK, Operations, Integrations,
      Concepts, Deployment).

### Quality

- [x] `ruff check services/` and `ruff format --check services/` clean
      across the whole `services/` tree (CI scope).
- [x] Targeted lint fixes committed: `E741` (ambiguous `l`),
      `F402` (loop var shadowing `dataclasses.field`),
      `E402` (post-`sys.path` import), `E501` long-string refactors in
      `case_postmortem_html.py`, `test_misp_push.py`, and `auditd.py`.
