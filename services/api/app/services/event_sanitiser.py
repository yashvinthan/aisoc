"""Sanitise inbound alert event payloads before persistence.

This module hardens the ``POST /alerts/submit`` direct-write path. The
submit endpoint takes a list of opaque dicts (``events: list[dict]``)
and stores the whole batch verbatim into the alert's ``raw_event``
JSONB column. That's convenient for forensics
— but it means any secret the caller's connector happened to embed
(session tokens, OAuth bearer tokens, API keys, passwords, …) lands in a
permanent, audit-replicated DB row.

The submit path is also unbounded: a single caller can post a 100 MB batch
of 100k events, each event 1 MB deep, and the synthesiser would happily
JSONB-encode the whole thing into one row. That's a denial-of-service vector
against the alerts table, the audit table, and downstream consumers
(narrative builder, fusion, websockets).

This module fixes both with one helper, :func:`sanitise_event_batch`. The
caller passes a raw list of dicts; we return:

* a redacted copy of the list, with sensitive keys replaced with the
  ``REDACTED_SENTINEL`` constant defined below;
* oversized events replaced with a small marker dict that preserves enough
  context for debugging (top-level keys, byte size) but drops the payload;
* a count of how many events were rejected for being too large and how
  many keys were redacted, so the endpoint can log a one-line summary.

The three caps are all environment-driven so an operator can tune them
without redeploying:

* ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_EVENTS``        — max events per batch (default 1000)
* ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_EVENT_BYTES``   — max serialised size per event
                                       (default 262144, i.e. 256 KiB)
* ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES``   — max serialised size for the whole
                                       batch after redaction (default
                                       4194304, i.e. 4 MiB)

Behaviour on cap breach:

* Batch length > ``MAX_EVENTS``     → caller-facing 413 Payload Too Large
                                       (raised by :func:`enforce_batch_caps`).
* Per-event size > ``MAX_EVENT_BYTES`` → event replaced inline with a
                                          truncation marker; nothing raised.
* Total size > ``MAX_TOTAL_BYTES``   → trailing events replaced with markers
                                        until the running total is under cap;
                                        nothing raised.

The intent is that one rogue event in a batch shouldn't drop the whole
submission — analysts still want the visibility on the *other* events —
but a deliberately oversized batch (caller is misconfigured or hostile)
gets a clean 4xx instead of crashing the worker.

# redacted at submit-time, regardless of which PR lands first. The
# patterns are deliberately broad — false positives (redacting a benign
# ``key`` field) are much cheaper than false negatives (leaking an OAuth
# bearer into a JSONB column that ends up replicated to read replicas
