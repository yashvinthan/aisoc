.SYNOPSIS
    AiSOC preflight checks for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Mirror of scripts/install/preflight.sh, but for the Windows + WSL2
    + Docker Desktop world. Designed to be dot-sourced by install.ps1
    *before* any prerequisite work, but can also be run standalone:

        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install\preflight.ps1

    The goal is to catch the failures that would happen 4 minutes from
    now — no disk, can't talk to ghcr.io, port 3000 is held by IIS, WSL2
    isn't installed, Docker Desktop is using Hyper-V instead of WSL2 —
    *before* we ask the user to download a gigabyte of images.

    Checks performed (in order):

        1.  Windows version (build 19041 / 20H1+ for WSL2)
        2.  CPU architecture (amd64 / arm64 only)
        3.  RAM (>= 4 GB hard, >= 8 GB recommended)
        4.  Free disk on the install drive (>= 10 GB hard, >= 20 GB rec)
        5.  Internet reachability (api.github.com, ghcr.io, npmjs.org)
        6.  WSL2 is installed and has a default distro
        7.  Docker Desktop service / engine is reachable (best effort)
        8.  Required ports (3000/5432/6379/8000/8001/8086/9092) are free
            OR held by an existing AiSOC container we can reuse
        9.  No leftover/conflicting AiSOC containers from a prior run
        10. Hyper-V vs WSL2 sanity check (warn if both seem half-on)

    Each check produces one of three states:

        PASS  - silent, just increments the success counter
        WARN  - yellow line, doesn't block install
        FAIL  - red line, increments fail counter

.PARAMETER Soft
    If set, the script writes the summary and exits 0 even with
    failures. install.ps1 uses this on its second pass after auto-fix.

.PARAMETER SkipNetwork
    Skip the connectivity probes (for air-gapped install testing).
    Failures become warnings.

.PARAMETER InstallRoot
    Root path used for the disk space check. Defaults to the parent of
    this script (so the repo root) when dot-sourced, or the current
    working directory when run standalone.

.OUTPUTS
    Exit code 0 = all checks passed (or only warnings)
    Exit code 1 = at least one hard failure
    Exit code 2 = preflight itself failed to gather data

.NOTES
    This script intentionally does NOT modify anything on the system.
    It only reads. install.ps1 is responsible for any fixes.
