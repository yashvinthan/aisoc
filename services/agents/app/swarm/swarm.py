"""Fan out competing hypothesis agents in parallel, each with a cost budget.

Each hypothesis agent independently "gathers evidence" (deterministically here:
scanning the alert text + techniques for supporting/contradicting signal) and
returns an evidence bundle + a raw support score. Agents run concurrently
(``asyncio.gather``); each is capped by a per-agent token/cost budget so the
swarm's total spend stays bounded and predictable.
