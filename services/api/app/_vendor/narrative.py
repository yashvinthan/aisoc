"""
Correlation narrative builder.

Wave 6 of the v1.5 SOC Console Parity plan. Every fused alert ships with a
human-readable, deterministic correlation narrative that the
``InvestigationRail`` on ``/alerts`` renders verbatim. The narrative answers
the analyst's first three questions in one short paragraph — *what fired*,
*what evidence supports it*, and *what we recommend next* — so the right pane
of the alerts workbench is useful **without** an LLM round-trip. The
streaming LLM explanation still exists; it sits behind a "Deep Explain"
button inside the rail (``POST /api/v1/alerts/{id}/explain``).

Design contract
===============

* **Deterministic.** Given identical inputs the output is byte-for-byte
  identical. No timestamps, no random ordering, no LLM. The output is safe to
  cache on the row and serve cold.
* **Pure.** ``build_narrative`` is a free function that takes a
  ``NarrativeInputs`` dataclass and returns a string. No database calls, no
  network, no logging side effects.
* **Vendored.** This module lives canonically in ``services/fusion`` and is
  byte-mirrored into ``services/api/app/_vendor/narrative.py`` so the API can
  lazily compute the narrative on first read for legacy alerts that were
  fused before the column existed. ``scripts/sync_vendored_narrative.py``
  guards the mirror; CI fails the build the moment the two copies drift.
* **Markdown-light.** The output uses a tiny markdown dialect — ``**bold**``,
  bullet lists, blank-line paragraphs. The rail renders these without a full
  markdown engine. No tables, no headings, no images.

Schema
======

The narrative is composed of up to four blocks separated by a blank line:

1. **Summary** — one sentence: *severity*, *title*, *primary entity*.
2. **Why we believe it** — up to four bullets pulled from the confidence
   rationale, sorted by impact, prefixed with ``+`` or ``−``.
3. **Correlated activity** — one short paragraph if the alert is part of an
   incident, otherwise omitted.
4. **Recommended next step** — one bullet derived from severity + MITRE
   tactic. Action surface is deliberately conservative; the rail also
   surfaces the LLM-generated remediation actions from the responder agent
   for cases that need richer planning.

If any block has no content it is dropped — the narrative never contains
empty sections.
