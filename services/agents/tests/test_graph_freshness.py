"""
T1.1 — Graph freshness integration test.

Publishes a synthetic OCSF event to the ingest service's Kafka topic, waits
for the ingest-side graph writer to project it into Neo4j, and asserts that
the projection is observable within p95 < 2s.

This is an integration test — it requires a running Kafka broker AND a
running Neo4j instance (or the docker-compose dev stack). On a developer
machine without those services it should *skip cleanly* rather than fail,
so ``pytest`` runs in CI without the docker stack stay green.

Mark with ``@pytest.mark.integration`` so CI can run this in a dedicated
matrix slot — `pytest -m integration services/agents/tests/test_graph_freshness.py`.

Coverage status:
- aws_security_hub  — covered (uses ``Resources[].Id`` natural key)
- okta_system_log   — covered (uses ``actor.id`` -> :Identity)
- github_audit      — covered (uses ``repo.full_name`` -> :Repo)
- kubernetes_audit  — covered (uses ``actor.user.name`` -> :User/:ServiceAccount)
- crowdstrike_falcon, microsoft_sentinel, splunk_enterprise — generic
  fallback (actor + endpoint nodes); deferred to T1.2 for full mapping.
- cloudflare/sublime/abnormal/lacework/sysdig/falco/vault/pagerduty/
  confluence/box/dropbox/datadog/snowflake/oci — generic fallback only;
  full mapping deferred to the T4 connector wave.

NOTE: 360-event synthetic corpus validation is a deterministic placeholder
in this scaffold — see TODO below. Expand once T1.2 lands.
