"""Schema fingerprinting for the Connector Health & Schema-Drift Sentinel.

We compute a stable hash of the *set of top-level field names* that appear
across a batch of normalized events. The hash is deliberately simple so that
two polls of the same upstream API produce the same fingerprint as long as
the field set is unchanged — even if values change, even if events arrive in
a different order, even if some events omit optional fields.

The intent is not to detect every possible upstream change (a value-type
change from string→int wouldn't be caught here, for example). The intent is
to catch the **single most common silent failure mode**: an upstream vendor
renames or removes a field, the connector's normalize() logic now produces
events missing critical attributes, and detections silently start firing
less frequently. Even this coarse fingerprint catches that case quickly.

Algorithm
---------

For a batch of N normalized events:

1. Union all top-level keys across all N events into a set.
2. Sort lexicographically (stable across runs, so the hash is stable).
3. Join with ``\\x1f`` (ASCII unit separator — guaranteed not to appear in
   a JSON field name).
4. SHA-256 the joined string and return the hex digest.

Two batches with identical field sets produce identical fingerprints.
A batch with one extra field (``new_field``) or one missing field produces
a different fingerprint, which the scheduler treats as drift.

Empty batches return ``None`` rather than a fingerprint of the empty set,
because we don't want a quiet hour (no events) to clobber the baseline
fingerprint we recorded the previous time the connector returned events.
