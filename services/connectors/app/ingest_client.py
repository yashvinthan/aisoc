"""HTTP client that forwards normalized events to the Go ingest service.

The connectors service polls each enabled connector instance and pushes the
normalized events here. The ingest service is in Go (services/ingest) and
exposes ``POST /v1/ingest`` and ``POST /v1/ingest/batch`` with the request
shape::

    {
      "connector_id": "...",
      "connector_type": "...",
      "source_format": "...",
      "events": [{...}, ...]
    }

with ``X-Tenant-ID`` header for tenant scoping.

We keep this layer **dumb on purpose**: no retries with exponential backoff
beyond a single retry, no circuit breaker, no batching across connectors.
The ingest service handles the queueing into Kafka — adding another buffer
layer in the connectors process would just move the failure point and add
state to a process we want to keep restartable. If the ingest service is
down, polls fail loudly and the scheduler records that in
``record_poll_failure``; the next poll cycle retries.
