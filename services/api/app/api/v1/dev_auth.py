"""Development authentication bypass.

When ``ENV`` names a dev-class environment and a request arrives without
a bearer token, we resolve a deterministic demo user. This makes the web
console usable without seeding users + logging in for every contributor
running the stack locally.

The demo IDs are also used by ``services/api/app/scripts/seed_demo.py``
so the data the UI sees actually belongs to the user that the API hands
back.

Production safety: this module reads ``ENV`` from the live process
environment at call time (not from the cached :class:`Settings`
singleton) so a test that does ``monkeypatch.setenv("ENV", "production")``
mid-suite immediately stops handing back the demo user. The canonical
allow-list lives in ``app.core.config.AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS`` and
deliberately excludes ``"test"`` — test suites must seed an
``Authorization`` header rather than rely on the bypass, or genuine auth
regressions get masked.
