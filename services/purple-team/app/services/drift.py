"""Detection drift snapshotting + delta computation.

Wave 1 of the AiSOC v6 capability roadmap (`w1-drift`) — turns the existing
ATT&CK coverage heatmap from a point-in-time view into a tracked time series
so the console can surface "delta vs. last week" on the MITRE heatmap.

Design notes
------------
The roadmap calls this "scheduled Atomic Red Team + Caldera runs". In
practice we do *not* execute attacks on a schedule — actual atomic
execution is gated behind an explicit human/operator action because it
mutates production endpoints. Instead, the scheduler periodically
*recomputes coverage from the existing execution history* and writes a
snapshot row, plus exposes an on-demand snapshot endpoint so operators
can capture coverage immediately after an exercise.

This still meets the "automated, not point-in-time" mandate from the
2026 buyer-side rubric: drift is detected by diffing the JSONB coverage
matrices of consecutive snapshots, regardless of *when* the underlying
runs happened.
