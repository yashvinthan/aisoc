## `problem` — Problem framing

- **Eyebrow:** `Why we built this`
- **H2:** `Your SOC is drowning in alerts.`
- **Sub-head:**
  `Three problems compound every shift. AiSOC was built to dissolve
  them, not paper over them.`
- **Pain bullets:**
  1. **Headline:** `Alert volume is up. Headcount is not.`
     **Body:** `A typical mid-market SOC sees more alerts in a single
     shift than an analyst can read end-to-end, and the AI tools that
     promise to triage them ship as black boxes you cannot audit.`
  2. **Headline:** `Context lives in eight tabs.`
     **Body:** `SIEM, EDR, cloud console, ticketing, chat, identity
     provider, on-call, runbook. Every alert is the same context-switch
     tax.`
  3. **Headline:** `You cannot defend a verdict you cannot read.`
     **Body:** `When an autonomous tool closes an alert, your analyst,
     your manager, and your auditor all need to know exactly why. Most
     vendors do not show the rationale.`

---

## `solution` — Solution overview (four agents)

- **Eyebrow:** `Four agents, one workflow`
- **H2:** `One agent for each stage of an incident.`
- **Sub-head:**
  `AiSOC ships exactly four named agents — Detect, Triage, Hunt, and
  Respond. Each one has a fixed job, a published capability list, and
  a replayable audit trail. Sub-agents (phishing, identity, cloud,
  insider) are capabilities of Triage, never separate brands.`

- **Card — Detect**
  - **Job:** `Fuse raw signals into incidents.`
  - **Capabilities:** `fusion · entity-risk (RBA) · native detections`
  - **Runs on:** `Deterministic · no LLM required`
- **Card — Triage**
  - **Job:** `Decide what matters and how urgent.`
  - **Capabilities:** `LLM auto-triage · phishing · identity · cloud ·
    insider`
  - **Runs on:** `OpenAI · Anthropic · Azure · Bedrock · Ollama · BYO
    endpoint`
- **Card — Hunt**
  - **Job:** `Ask new questions across the data.`
  - **Capabilities:** `NL → ES|QL · KQL · SPL · scheduled YAML hunts`
  - **Runs on:** `Cloud LLM or local model`
- **Card — Respond**
  - **Job:** `Plan containment, gate execution, approve via ChatOps.`
  - **Capabilities:** `response planner · SOAR exec · approvals`
  - **Runs on:** `L0–L4 maturity dial, dry-run by default`

## `demo` — Live demo

- **Eyebrow:** `See it work`
- **H2:** `Watch AiSOC investigate a live ransomware incident.`
- **Sub-head:**
  `INC-RT-001 is a LockBit 3.0 case that ships with every install. The
  ledger streams every prompt, tool call, and decision the agent made.
  Scrub the timeline, pause on any step, fork the rationale into a
  ticket.`
- **Frame caption (overlaid bottom-left):** `INC-RT-001 · LockBit 3.0 ·

## `faq` — FAQ

1. **Q.** `Is AiSOC really open source?`
   **A.** `Yes — the agent, the connectors, the detection rules, the
   benchmark dataset, and every piece of infrastructure code are
   MIT-licensed. There is no private fork.`
2. **Q.** `What does the agent need to call out to?`
   **A.** `By default the Triage and Hunt agents call an LLM provider
   you configure (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, or a private
   LiteLLM gateway). Set AISOC_AIRGAPPED=true and the platform refuses
   every outbound call; an Ollama sidecar runs a local model in-cluster.`
3. **Q.** `Where does my data live?`
   **A.** `Self-host: wherever you point Postgres, ClickHouse, and
   Redis. Managed: EU, US, or India region you pick at signup.
   Sovereign: a single-tenant VPC you control. The connector vault
   encrypts secrets with Fernet AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256.`
4. **Q.** `Can the agent take real-world action without a human?`
   **A.** `Only inside the maturity tier you configure. L0 keeps the
   agent advisory only; L2 (the production default) lets it run
   reversible containment actions; L4 allows whitelisted closed-loop
   actions. Every action class is gated against blast radius.`
5. **Q.** `How is this benchmarked?`
   **A.** `Five pytest suites in services/agents/tests/ run on every
   PR. Three are substrate self-consistency gates; the fourth is a
   real measurement against a fixed 1,000-alert noisy stream; the
   fifth is a coverage gate on the synthetic telemetry corpus. The
   methodology page documents what each suite measures and what it
   does not.`
6. **Q.** `How do connectors work?`
   **A.** `Each connector is a Python class that declares a schema,
   tests its credentials, polls on a schedule, and normalises events
   into OCSF. 69 ship in the box. The plugin SDKs (Python, TypeScript,
   Go) let you author your own in roughly 50 lines.`
7. **Q.** `What runs in production today?`
   **A.** `Beta deployments through reference partners and an internal
   demo on tryaisoc.com. The managed waitlist at tryaisoc.com is the
   route for hosted customers.`
8. **Q.** `Why not just use an existing AI SOC vendor?`
   **A.** `Use whichever tools fit your risk and procurement model.
   AiSOC's contribution is making the agent itself open, the decisions
   step-by-step auditable, and the benchmark reproducible — three
   guarantees closed-source platforms typically do not offer.`
