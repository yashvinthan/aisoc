"""Demo-mode guard for the hosted demo at tryaisoc.com.

When `AISOC_DEMO_MODE=true`, this middleware:

1. **Surfaces a banner.** Adds `X-AiSOC-Demo: true` and
   `X-AiSOC-Demo-Banner: <message>` headers on every response so the web
   client can render the "demo data resets daily" notice.
2. **Blocks destructive writes.** Any non-safe HTTP method (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
   targeting a mutating endpoint returns 403 with a structured payload
   explaining how to self-host. We allow a small allowlist (auth, dev_auth,
   investigation kickoff against the canonical case) so the canned demo
   experience still works end-to-end.

This is *not* a substitute for proper auth/RBAC — it's a defense-in-depth
layer on top of the demo tenant's read-only RBAC role. Without it, a
visitor poking at `/api/v1/cases` could mutate the global demo state for
every other concurrent visitor.

Configured in `app.main.create_application` after CORS/GZip so the headers
land on cached error responses too.
