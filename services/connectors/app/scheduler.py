"""APScheduler-driven polling loop for enabled connector instances.

The connectors microservice runs a single ``ConnectorScheduler`` per process,
started in the FastAPI lifespan and stopped on shutdown. The scheduler:

1. Periodically reloads the enabled-connector list from Postgres (the API
   service owns the ``connectors`` table; we read it directly via SQLAlchemy
   Core).
2. For each enabled instance, schedules an async job that runs every
   ``connector_config.poll_interval_seconds`` (default 300s = 5 min).
3. On each tick, the job decrypts ``auth_config`` via the vendored
   ``CredentialVault``, instantiates the connector class with the merged
   config, calls ``fetch_alerts()``, normalizes each event, and pushes the
   batch to ``services/ingest`` via ``IngestClient``.
4. Records success or failure on the connector row so the UI / health
   dashboards can show per-connector status.

Design rationale
----------------

* **APScheduler in-process** instead of Celery / RQ / a Go daemon: the
  poll workload is tiny (one HTTP round-trip per source per 5 min) and
  the per-connector logic is already async Python. Standing up a broker
  for this would be over-engineering, and we'd lose direct access to the
  connector classes' Python types. APScheduler's ``AsyncIOScheduler`` runs
  on the existing FastAPI event loop with effectively zero overhead for
  idle connectors.

* **Reload from DB, don't watch**: the API service can create / disable
  / update connectors at any time. Rather than wire up a pub/sub
  notification channel (LISTEN/NOTIFY, Redis pubsub, etc.) we just refetch
  the enabled set every ``RELOAD_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` (60s by default).
  Worst case a newly-created connector waits up to 60s for its first
  poll, which is fine — humans don't care about that latency for a thing
  that polls every 5 minutes anyway.

* **One async job per instance**: APScheduler schedules each connector
  by ``connector_id`` (UUID string). When we reload, any connector_id we
  no longer see gets ``remove_job``'d, any new one gets ``add_job``'d,
  and any existing one stays put. Idempotent reloads keep the scheduler
  state in sync with the DB without restart races.

* **Failures are recorded, not raised**: ``record_poll_failure`` updates
  the row's health status; we never let an exception escape the job
  function because APScheduler would then start de-prioritising the job.
  We *do* emit the exception via ``logger.exception`` so it shows up in
  centralized logs.

# for >30 min and then recovers").
#
# We also enforce a flap-suppression window: if a backfill ran within the
# last ``_BACKFILL_FLAP_WINDOW_S`` we won't fire another one even if
# ``last_outage_at`` looks long. This prevents re-firing on a recovery
# that briefly toggled back to unhealthy and then to healthy again.
