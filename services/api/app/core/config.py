# Canonical "dev mode" detection (H-8 + P2-A3).
#
# Before unification, the codebase had at least four different sets of
# strings hand-rolled across multiple modules — each with a slightly
# different list ("dev", "development", "local", "demo", sometimes
# "test", sometimes none of the above). That meant the same boot could
# count as "dev" for one check and "prod" for another, silently
# bypassing safety rails or, worse, gating them on the wrong axis.
#
# These two frozensets are now the **only** truth in the codebase.
#
# ``DEV_ENVIRONMENTS``      – Used by most subsystems (table autocreate,
#                             docs URLs, /metrics gate, structured-vs-JSON
#                             logging, GraphiQL UI, credential-vault
#                             ephemeral key, insecure-default warnings).
#                             Includes ``"test"`` because pytest sets
#                             ``ENV=test`` and we never want to gate
#                             test-suite behaviour behind production
#                             rails (e.g. requiring a real Fernet key).
#
# ``AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS`` – Used **only** by the request-time
#                                no-credentials-→-demo-user shim in
#                                ``app.api.v1.dev_auth``. Deliberately
#                                excludes ``"test"`` so a test suite
#                                that forgets to seed an Authorization
#                                header gets a 401 instead of being
#                                handed admin-on-the-demo-tenant — that
#                                used to mask real auth regressions.
