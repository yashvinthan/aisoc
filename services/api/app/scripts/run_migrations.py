"""Apply raw SQL migrations under ``services/api/migrations``.

This is a lightweight, idempotent migration runner. Each migration is executed
in its own asyncpg connection and tracked in an ``aisoc_schema_migrations``
table so it will not be re-applied on subsequent runs. Migrations themselves
are written defensively (``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``, ``ALTER TABLE … ADD
COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS``) so partial re-applies are safe.

Why a dedicated asyncpg connection (not SQLAlchemy)?
----------------------------------------------------
The migration files frequently contain multi-statement SQL scripts
(``BEGIN; … COMMIT;``, multiple ``CREATE TABLE`` statements, etc.). SQLAlchemy
+ asyncpg routes everything through asyncpg's *prepared statement* protocol,
which raises ``cannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement``.
We previously worked around this by reaching for the underlying asyncpg
connection inside ``engine.begin()``. That fixed the multi-statement issue,
but mixing raw ``Connection.execute()`` with SQLAlchemy's transaction
management left pool connections in an inconsistent state — every later
request that landed on a poisoned connection failed with ``cannot use
Connection.transaction() in a manually started transaction``. Using a
fresh, short-lived asyncpg connection (closed before the API starts serving
traffic) avoids both problems.
