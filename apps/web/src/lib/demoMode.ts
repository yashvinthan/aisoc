/**
 * Demo-mode helpers for the hosted demo at tryaisoc.com.
 *
 * Reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` (set by `infra/fly/web/fly.toml`) to flag-gate
 * write actions in the UI:
 *
 *   - `isDemoMode()`            → true when the deployment is the hosted demo
 *   - `demoBannerMessage()`     → the banner copy to render at the top of every page
 *   - `demoDeeplink()`          → the `/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger` deeplink the
 *                                 README "Live Demo" button targets, so we land
 *                                 visitors on a hot, mid-investigation view
 *
 * The component side of this lives at `components/demo/DemoBanner.tsx`.
 *
 * Why a module instead of inlining `process.env`? Three reasons:
 *
 *   1. Tree-shake-friendly: pages that never call these helpers don't bundle
 *      the banner copy.
 *   2. Single source of truth: server actions, client components, and tests
 *      all read demo state through one shim.
 *   3. Test seam: stories/tests can monkey-patch `__setDemoModeForTests` to
 *      render the banner regardless of build env.
 *
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars are inlined at build time by Next, so this module can
 * safely run in both Server and Client components.
