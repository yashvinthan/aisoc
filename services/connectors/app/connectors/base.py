"""
Base connector interface for all integrations.

Every connector subclass owns:
  * ``connector_id`` / ``connector_name`` / ``connector_category`` —
    identity used in the catalog and registry lookups.
  * ``schema()`` — a self-describing config schema returned to the
    frontend's "Add connector" wizard. This replaces the centralised
    dict that used to live in ``services/connectors/app/api/router.py``.
  * ``test_connection()`` / ``fetch_alerts()`` / ``normalize()`` — the
    runtime contract used by the polling scheduler.

The schema is intentionally JSON-shaped (not Pydantic) because it is
serialised straight to the wire for the click-and-connect UI. We keep
typed dataclasses here as an authoring aid so a typo (e.g. ``"sercret"``
for ``"secret"``) is caught at import time, not at form-render time.

# Capability taxonomy (Workstream 4)
#
# Capabilities describe *what an agent can ask a connector to do*, not how the
# connector is configured. They are intentionally coarse-grained so the agent
# can plan ("I want to isolate a host" → look for any connector exposing
# ``ISOLATE_HOST``) without tripping over vendor-specific verbs.
#
# Buckets — keep in sync with the plan doc (READ / QUERY / PIVOT / ENRICH /
# CONTAIN / REMEDIATE / TICKET / AUDIT). Adding a new capability:
#   1. Add the enum member here.
#   2. Update the relevant connectors' ``capabilities()`` classmethod.
#   3. Update ``test_capabilities`` in ``services/connectors/tests/test_capabilities.py``.
#
# Per-instance downscoping happens in the API layer: an operator can store an
# ``allowed_capabilities`` whitelist on a ``Connector`` row and the agent
# router will intersect it with the connector class's declared capabilities.
