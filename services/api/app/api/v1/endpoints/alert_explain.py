"""POST ``/alerts/{alert_id}/explain`` — structured AI explainer.

This endpoint is the API-side counterpart to the existing NDJSON
streaming explainer in ``services/agents``. The agent service still
exists for the *streaming* console UX (token-by-token); this endpoint
exists so console clients, the case-summary PDF builder, and headless
SOAR playbooks can ask one question — *"what is this alert?"* — and
get back a structured JSON envelope with:

* ``rule_lineage``     — which detection rule fired (best-effort)
* ``contributing_events`` — the raw event signals that drove it
* ``mitre_techniques`` — resolved ATT&CK cards
* ``historical_fp_rate`` — per-rule (or per-category) FPR over the
  last 30 days
* ``suggested_actions``  — deterministic, hand-curated next steps
* ``summary``            — LLM-written or deterministic-fallback prose

The work itself lives in :mod:`app.services.alert_explain`; this
module is purely an HTTP shell. It is responsible for:

1. Permission gating (``alerts:read``).
2. Per-tenant rate limiting via :class:`ExplainRateLimiter`. Explain
   calls hit an LLM and run two analytic queries; without a cap a
   misbehaving frontend or a runaway agent loop can drain budget in
   minutes.
3. Loading the alert under the tenant-scoped session (RLS) so the
   downstream query helpers can safely run untenanted queries.
4. Emitting an audit event — explains are user-visible LLM calls and
   compliance auditors want a paper trail.

The endpoint is mounted under the existing alerts prefix, so the
final path is ``POST /api/v1/alerts/{alert_id}/explain``.
