# Attack-chain timeline (T3.3 — v8.0 parallel team plan).

# Pipeline health snapshot — v1.5 SOC Console parity.

# and pipeline-health widgets on /dashboard speak the same language.
api_router.include_router(health.router)
# SOC Insights aggregator (T3.1 — v8.0 parallel team plan).
# Backs apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboards/soc-insights/page.tsx with a

api_router.include_router(insights.router)

# Public investigation-replay publishing — v8 W3.
# /ledger/{run_id}/publish[/preview] (auth) turns a tenant-private ledger into
# an immutable, redacted snapshot; /r/{slug} serves it publicly (no auth,
# non-RLS by design — the data is post-redaction and non-identifying) for the

api_router.include_router(replay.router)

# Effective permissions resolver (T3.2 — v8.0 parallel team plan).

# edges in Neo4j. Backs apps/web/src/app/(app)/identity/permissions.
api_router.include_router(effective_permissions.router)

# Cost dashboard — WS-H1 (buyer-value plan).
# Aggregates LLM spend / token volume from aisoc_run_costs joined with

# imputed from public list pricing. Backs apps/web/src/app/(admin)/costs.

# Per-user saved views — WS-F3 (analyst quality-of-life).
# Backs the saved-views menu on Alerts/Cases/Investigations/Playbooks
# list pages. Per-user-per-tenant CRUD; tenant scoping via RLS, user
# scoping in the API layer (every query filters on user_id).

# Configurable autonomy guardrails — three-tier per-action confidence (Tier 1.3)
api_router.include_router(autonomy_policy.router)

# Business Context Rules — Track 3, T3.5 (v8.0 parallel team plan).
# YAML rule engine that mutates fused alerts (severity bump, route, suppress,
# tag) before they reach the triage agent. Backs the
# /settings/business-context Monaco editor with a dry-run preview API.
api_router.include_router(business_context.router)

# NL detection authoring (Tier 2)

# Hypothesis-driven hunt workbench (Tier 2)
api_router.include_router(hunts.router)

# Saved natural-language hunts — Track 3, T3.4 (`/hunt` NL surface).
# Backs the "Saved hunts" sidebar on the /hunt page. Stores the analyst's
# plain-English question + translator output, optionally on a cron. Tenant-
# shared (every analyst in the tenant sees every saved hunt). Distinct from
# /hunts (above), which is the heavyweight detection-engineer hunt workbench.
api_router.include_router(saved_hunts.router)

# Email-security + phishing-triage workflow (Tier 3)

# Air-gap status snapshot for operators — Tier 3.1 (air-gapped certification)
api_router.include_router(airgap.router)

# LLM provider visibility for the "Deployment & AI" Settings panel.
# Mirrors /airgap/status: read-only env-var snapshot, never returns the
# API key itself. Same code path the egress gate uses, so the indicator
# in the UI cannot drift from runtime behaviour (WS-H2/H4 visibility).
api_router.include_router(llm_status.router)

# BYOK per-tenant LLM credentials — WS-H2 (buyer-value plan).
# Settings-write CRUD over tenant_llm_credentials. The plaintext API key
# is encrypted via the credential vault before it touches Postgres; the
# read path returns has_api_key/last_rotated_at but never the key itself.
# Resolution order at request time is per-tenant row > env-var fallback
# (see llm_status.py + agents/explain.py).
api_router.include_router(llm_credentials.router)

# STIX/TAXII threat intelligence publishing (Tier 4)
api_router.include_router(stix_taxii.router)

# Shift handoff and SOC analyst scheduling

# Deployment configuration and air-gap bundle management
api_router.include_router(deployment.router)

# Fusion gateway: proxies to services/fusion when FUSION_URL is set, otherwise
# returns graceful empty payloads so the analyst console renders cleanly.
api_router.include_router(fusion.router)

# Agent-facing tool surface (Workstream 4 of AI Stack plan).
# /agents/tools returns the tenant-scoped, downscope-filtered list of
# (connector instance × capability) pairs the agent layer is allowed to
# invoke. Read-only — actual invocation lives in the agents service.
api_router.include_router(agents.router)

# Universal capture push paths (Workstream 6 of AI Stack plan).
# /inbox/templates + /inbox/tokens manage the per-tenant rotatable inbox
# URLs the wizard's "Push (any vendor)" card hands out. Vendor traffic
# itself terminates at services/ingest, which resolves the token to a
# tenant + template_id and reuses the existing OCSF normalizer.
api_router.include_router(inbox.router)

# Bidirectional ITSM webhook receiver (Workstream 8 of AI Stack plan).
# /inbox/itsm/{tenant_token}/{connector_instance_id} accepts inbound
# Jira / ServiceNow webhooks, resolves the external ticket back to its
# AiSOC case via case_external_refs, and mirrors the status onto
# aisoc_cases. This is the *inbound* counterpart to case_fanout (which
# handles outbound AiSOC → ITSM projection) and is what makes the
# operator's existing ITSM the source of truth for case status.
api_router.include_router(inbox_itsm.router)

# Tenant lake API (Workstream 7 of AI Stack plan).
# /lake/sql executes a tenant-scoped SELECT against the warm tier
# (ClickHouse) after passing through the SQL rewriter, which enforces a
# table allowlist, injects tenant_id predicates, clamps LIMIT, and
# rejects DML/DDL/table-valued functions. /lake/schema returns the
# allowlisted table catalog so operators (and LLM agents) can author
# queries without column-name guesswork.
api_router.include_router(lake.router)

# Managed-instance onboarding — T6.1 (`tryaisoc.com` beta).
# /waitlist exposes the public signup + admin entries CRUD that feeds
# the sales funnel; /admin/tenants promotes approved entries into live
# tenants. Admin endpoints gate on `admin:waitlist` / `admin:tenants`
# (falling back to `settings:write` for tenants whose RBAC rows have
# not been migrated to the granular admin scope yet).
api_router.include_router(waitlist.router)
api_router.include_router(tenant_provision.router)

# Public-facing graph-update WebSocket proxy — T1.4 (v8.0 parallel team plan).
# /graph_ws/stream authenticates the browser's session token, rebinds the
# tenant_id from the resolved user, and proxies to the internal ingest
# broadcaster (AISOC_INGEST_GRAPH_WS_URL). Backs the RealtimeGraph
# Cytoscape view; gates on graph:read.
api_router.include_router(graph_ws.router)

# Short-lived realtime WS/SSE ticket minting — Issue #239.
# POST /realtime/ticket authenticates the browser's session token and mints a
# short-TTL (≤60s), audience-scoped HS256 ticket signed with the shared
# AISOC_REALTIME_JWT_SECRET. The Node realtime service verifies it on every WS
# upgrade and SSE request, deriving the tenant from the verified claim so the
# fan-out edge is no longer unauthenticated.
api_router.include_router(realtime.router)
