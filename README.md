## Try AiSOC in 60 seconds

One command — no clone, no Docker, no keys (`npx aisoc` lands on npm with the v8.0 launch; today it builds from [`packages/aisoc-lite/`](packages/aisoc-lite/)):

```bash
npx aisoc triage --demo
# ✓ AiSOC triaged 200 alerts: 12 TP, 171 FP suppressed (85.5% noise), 17 need review — in 0.1s
```

The wedge CLI scores a batch of alerts to verdicts (escalate / review / suppress) with a deterministic engine ported from the production triage scorer — zero LLM key required. Or pick whichever path matches what you already have on your machine:

| If you have…                          | Run this                                                                                                 | What you get                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python 3.10+** (no Docker)          | `pip install -e packages/aisoc-sandbox && aisoc-sandbox demo`                                            | Offline agent investigation walked through Detect → Triage → Hunt → Respond and printed to stdout. **< 5 s.** No API key, no network. |
| **A browser** (zero install)          | [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/beenuar/AiSOC?quickstart=1)                                  | Browser IDE → `pnpm aisoc:demo --no-open` → click forwarded port `3000`. ~5 min cold.              |
| **Docker + pnpm**                     | `git clone https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc && cd AiSOC && pnpm aisoc:demo`                              | Local stack on Postgres + Redis + Kafka + api + agents + web. Browser opens at `INC-RT-001`.       |
| **Nothing** (clean Linux/macOS/Win)   | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.sh \| bash`                     | Bootstraps Docker, Node, pnpm, git for you; then runs `pnpm aisoc:demo`.                           |

The first row is new: [`aisoc-sandbox`](packages/aisoc-sandbox/) is a zero-dependency, in-memory simulator of the agent funnel. Pick a [bundled scenario](packages/aisoc-sandbox/README.md#bundled-scenarios) (`lateral-movement`, `aws-credential-exfil`, `phishing-payload`, `kubernetes-privesc`, `github-token-theft`) or feed in your own JSON via `--file`. The other three rows boot the real stack and land you on `/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger` — a LockBit 3.0 ransomware case mid-investigation, with the AI agent's prompts, tool calls, and rationale streaming into the [Investigation Ledger](apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md). Stop the real stack with `pnpm aisoc:demo:down`.

> **Does the demo still boot on `main`?** Every push runs [`compose-smoke`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/actions/workflows/compose-smoke.yml) (the same `pnpm aisoc:demo` path you'd run locally) and [`e2e`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/actions/workflows/e2e.yml) against the seeded console; nightly [`compose-smoke-nightly`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/actions/workflows/compose-smoke-nightly.yml) repeats it with cold caches.

## What AiSOC is

AiSOC is a single self-hostable stack that ingests security events, correlates them, runs AI-driven investigation, and surfaces the result in a SOC console. The agent and the substrate are MIT-licensed, so you can read, fork, or replace either of them.

Three properties distinguish it from closed-source AI SOC vendors:

1. **Agent decisions are logged.** The Investigation Ledger stores the LLM prompt, the response, the evidence cited, and the downstream tool calls for every step of every run. Replays are available later.
2. **The substrate has a public eval harness in CI.** Five suites gate every PR targeting `main` / `develop` — alert reduction is a real measurement against a fixed 1 000-alert stream; three rubric-based suites are substrate self-consistency gates over a deterministic 200-incident dataset (55 templates) with per-template macros; a fifth gate validates the backing telemetry corpus. The [benchmark page](apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md) documents exactly what each suite measures and what it does not.
3. **You control what leaves your perimeter.** No callbacks to a vendor cloud and no "model improvement" telemetry. With a hosted LLM, evidence is pseudonymized by default (internal IPs, hostnames, emails, paths, secrets, usernames become opaque tokens); run a local model (Ollama/vLLM) for a fully air-gapped path. Exactly what leaves under each mode: [`docs/trust/data-flows.md`](docs/trust/data-flows.md).

The orchestrator is a ~600-line LangGraph in [`services/agents/`](services/agents/). It is small enough to read end-to-end, swap models in, and patch.

## How AiSOC compares

| Capability | AiSOC | Wazuh | Splunk ES | Closed-source AI SOC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open-source license | MIT | GPL-2 | proprietary | proprietary |
| Self-hostable | yes | yes | enterprise-only | cloud-only |
| Autonomous AI investigation | LangGraph | no | partial (Splunk AI) | yes |
| Agent decision audit trail | public Investigation Ledger | n/a | n/a | not published |
| Public substrate eval harness | CI-gated, reproducible, with synthetic telemetry corpus + per-template macros | n/a | n/a | not published |
| Detection content | 947 executable (869 native) firing on the live stream + 6 000-rule provenance-tracked imported library ([truth table](docs/detections/truth-table.md)) | 1 200+ rules | 1 000+ apps | curated |
| Plugin SDK | Python / TypeScript / Go | YAML rules only | apps | proprietary |
| Data residency | your infra | your infra | partial | vendor cloud |
| Pricing | $0 (self-host) | $0 (self-host) | per ingest GB | enterprise |

Closed-source AI SOC vendors ship working products. AiSOC's contribution is making the agent itself open, the per-step decision trail readable, and the substrate gated by a public eval harness on every PR targeting `main` / `develop`.

## What's in the box

A handful of headline capabilities — the rest are catalogued in [`apps/docs/docs/features/`](apps/docs/docs/features/) and indexed at the top of [`apps/docs/docs/intro.md`](apps/docs/docs/intro.md):

> **Maturity (v7.7.0 — Fully-Operational release).** The end-to-end spine is wired and CI-gated: ingest → ClickHouse lake → live detection → fused alert → auto-triage → governed response. Connectors, Investigation Rail + Ledger, Hunt-as-Code, live-stream detection, and copilot auto-triage are GA. Autonomous *response* defaults to copilot/dry-run (an autonomy policy governs every real execution). The live-agent LLM benchmark is preview (the deterministic-tier scoreboard is CI-gated per PR); substrate eval suites are GA. Every product claim is backed by a failing test — [claim-to-gate matrix](docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md): 46 GATED / 9 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE. Full per-claim status: [`docs/audit/REALITY_REPORT.md`](docs/audit/REALITY_REPORT.md). v7.7.0 adds three detection-authoring modes (Python framework + AI builder + no-code), least-privilege invoking-identity scoping for response actions, self-service data lifecycle (retention + a ReDoS-proof transform DSL + custom parsers), an agentless CSPM scanner with compliance auto-evidence and Opsgenie/email/SOAR destinations, and a customizable report builder — all tested, all landed on `main`.

- **83 click-and-connect data connectors** (EDR/XDR, SIEM, NDR, cloud, CNAPP, identity, SaaS, VCS, K8s audit, network) with schema-driven config, live `Test connection`, and vault-encrypted secrets — recently adding Qualys, GreyNoise, JumpCloud, Darktrace, and Imperva alongside IBM QRadar, Netskope, Zeek/Suricata NDR, and more. One query runs SIEM-agnostic **federated search** across Splunk SPL / Sentinel KQL / Elastic ES&#124;QL / **QRadar AQL**. Walkthrough: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md).
- **End-to-end SIEM spine** — a cold `docker compose up` ingests connector data → lands it in the ClickHouse event lake → the executable detection corpus (947 rules) fires on the live stream → a fused alert is created, all asserted by an extended integration gate. Fuse-time threat-intel + CISA-KEV enrichment now feeds the confidence score and exploit-in-wild boost, and **stateful/windowed detections** (brute-force, password-spray, port-scan) run alongside the corpus. [`apps/docs/docs/architecture.md`](apps/docs/docs/architecture.md).
- **Autonomous triage + governed response** — every fused alert is auto-triaged by the agent (copilot/read-only by default) with a prompt-injection guard that demotes tampered evidence to manual review; a unified **confidence × blast-radius × reversibility** policy authorizes auto-execution only for reversible, low-blast actions at high confidence (everything else stays gated to a human), with real rollback + post-action verification. [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md).
- **Advanced Data Explorer** — one investigation surface (NL + SQL over the lake, plus pivots to identity/graph/intel), replacing the SIEM context-switch. `/explore`.
- **Investigation Rail + replayable Investigation Ledger** — every prompt, tool call, evidence chip, and rationale stored against a case, replayable in the UI and shareable as a redacted public permalink ([live demo replay](https://tryaisoc.com/r/demo-lockbit)). [`apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md).
- **Detection-as-Code lifecycle** — propose → review → eval-gate → promote; CI rejects any candidate that fails its own positive/negative fixtures (the non-circular gate) or regresses MITRE accuracy. Analyst false-positive feedback now feeds a **self-improving tuner** that proposes scoped rule exceptions / severity changes (human-approved, never auto-applied). [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/detections.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/detections.md) — and the 869 native rules live in [`detections/`](detections/).
- **Three-model AI + tool-using agents** — Semantic (graph-at-ingest), Behavioral (UEBA fused into alert scoring), and Knowledge (LLM), with fuse-time attack-chain grouping. The agent calls real tools (IOC enrichment, MITRE lookup, graph blast-radius) through an **LLM tool-calling loop**, and a **scored planner** routes each alert to the right specialist instead of fanning out to all four.
- **Cost-governed LLM routing** — per-tenant budgets + circuit breaker, token/cost telemetry, a content-addressed response cache, a cheap-first cost cascade (escalate to the strong model only on low confidence), multi-model gateway fallbacks, and per-tenant BYOK keys. [`services/agents/app/routing/`](services/agents/app/routing/).
- **Hunt-as-Code** — YAML hypotheses with MITRE tags, cron schedules, and natural-language `/hunt` workbench. [`hunts/`](hunts/) + [`apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md). Plus free, login-free [browser tools](https://tryaisoc.com/tools): a Sigma/SPL/KQL/ES&#124;QL rule translator, an ATT&CK coverage grader, NL→Sigma, and a noise calculator.
- **Public weekly benchmark scoreboard** — the same harness that gates PRs; the deterministic-tier row is CI-gated for freshness on every PR, and the funded weekly job appends live-LLM rows. A new **groundedness/hallucination axis** flags any indicator the agent asserts that isn't in the evidence it was given. [`apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx`](apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx).

## Use it from Claude, Cursor, or Cody

AiSOC ships an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (`services/mcp/`) so analysts can query alerts, run agent investigations, and replay every step the agent took without leaving the IDE or chat. The server exposes 13 tools — discovery, deep-dive, governed lake query, and the action / replay set that walks the agent decision ledger step-by-step.

> **Status — monorepo source build today; npm publish lands in v8.0.** Full setup is in [`apps/docs/docs/integrations/mcp.md`](apps/docs/docs/integrations/mcp.md), which shows the today-vs-v8.0 invocations side by side.

---

## Extend it

Three contribution surfaces; each is one file plus optional fixtures, and CI validates every PR.

- **Detection rule.** Drop a Sigma YAML under [`detections/`](detections/) with a positive / negative fixture in [`detections/fixtures/`](detections/fixtures/). The [validate-detections](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/actions/workflows/validate-detections.yml) workflow tests it on every PR. Spec: [`docs/connectors/`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/).
- **Connector.** Subclass `BaseConnector` in [`services/connectors/app/connectors/`](services/connectors/app/connectors/), register it in `_CONNECTOR_CLASSES`, and add a `plugins/<id>/plugin.yaml` manifest. The marketplace picks it up automatically. Walkthrough: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/).
- **Playbook.** Drop a YAML under [`playbooks/`](playbooks/); [`validate-playbooks`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/actions/workflows/validate-playbooks.yml) gates the PR. Schema: [`playbook.schema.json`](playbook.schema.json).

Plugin and detection SDK (Python · TypeScript · Go) — see [`apps/docs/docs/plugins/overview.md`](apps/docs/docs/plugins/overview.md). The CLI (`aisoc-cli`) is in [`packages/aisoc-cli/`](packages/aisoc-cli/); PyPI publish lands in v8.0.

**In your CI:** add `- uses: beenuar/aisoc-action@v1` to triage your repo's Dependabot / CodeQL / secret-scanning alerts on every PR (deterministic, nothing leaves your runner; dogfooded on this repo, Marketplace publish lands with v8.0). [Docs](apps/docs/docs/integrations/github-action.md).
