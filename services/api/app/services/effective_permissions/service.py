"""Effective-permissions dispatcher + Neo4j cache writer (T3.2).

The API endpoint calls :func:`resolve_effective_permissions` with a provider
string and a principal id. This module:

1. Picks the right :class:`Resolver` (raising :class:`ValueError` for an
   unknown provider — translated to HTTP 400 by the endpoint).
2. Loads the provider's snapshot. Production wiring would read from S3 /
   Neo4j; the in-tree implementation accepts an explicit ``snapshot_loader``
   so tests inject fixtures without monkey-patching.
3. Calls :meth:`Resolver.resolve` and gets a :class:`ResolverResult`.
4. Best-effort caches the result into Neo4j as
   ``(:Identity {id})-[:EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION {actions, ...}]->(:Resource {id})``
   so downstream queries can hop to it without re-running the resolver. The
   cache write is wrapped in a broad ``try/except`` and logged — Neo4j being
   down must never break the synchronous read path.

The :data:`SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS` mapping is the single source of truth for the
provider list — the API endpoint imports it for input validation and the UI
calls ``GET /v1/identity/effective-permissions/providers`` to render the
provider switcher.
