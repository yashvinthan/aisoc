    so that a hand-crafted fixture lands in the database — and therefore in
    ``GET /api/v1/alerts`` and the web console — within the same second.

    **Hardening (Batch 8 / H-5)**:

    * **Payload caps** — events are first run through
      :func:`app.services.event_sanitiser.sanitise_event_batch`, which
      enforces ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_EVENTS`` (default 200), per-event size
      ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_EVENT_BYTES`` (default 64 KiB), and total batch
      size ``AISOC_SUBMIT_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`` (default 1 MiB). Violations
      return ``413 Payload Too Large`` rather than the 200 OK + truncated
      alert we used to silently emit.
    * **Secret redaction** — the sanitiser also redacts keys matching
      common secret patterns (``password``, ``token``, ``api_key``, …)
      *before* the payload is persisted to ``alerts.raw_event``, so a
      leaky connector cannot smuggle bearer tokens into the alert table
      where they would be visible to every analyst with ``alerts:read``.
    * **Idempotency** — when the client supplies an ``Idempotency-Key``
      header, the resulting alert is keyed ``(tenant_id, idempotency_key)``
      via a partial unique index (migration ``044``). A retry of the
      same key resolves to the existing row and returns HTTP ``200``
      instead of creating a duplicate, so at-least-once connectors and
      the ``aisoc submit`` CLI can retry safely on network blips.
    * **Timestamp bounds** — event timestamps outside the configured
      retention window are clamped (see
      :mod:`app.services.timestamp_bounds`); the resulting alert is
      tagged ``ts-clamped`` so analysts can see the connector misbehaved.

    Authorisation: requires ``alerts:write``. In development mode the
    auth bypass in :mod:`app.api.v1.deps` resolves to the deterministic
    demo tenant, so the documented ``aisoc submit`` CLI works against a
    fresh clone with no token plumbing.
