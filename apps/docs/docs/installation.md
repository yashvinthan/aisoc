# One-click install

The fastest way to a running AiSOC dashboard, with **zero assumed
prerequisites**, is the bootstrap installer. It works against a
freshly-imaged machine — no Docker, Node, pnpm, git, or even Homebrew
required up front. It detects your OS, installs everything idempotently,
clones the repo, and launches the demo stack with seeded data and a
mid-investigation case open in your browser.

If you already have Docker + Node + pnpm and you want to skip straight to
the demo orchestrator, see the [Quick start](./quickstart). If you are
deploying to production, see [Deployment options](./deployment/docker).

## TL;DR

```bash
# Linux + macOS (one-liner):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

When the installer finishes, your default browser opens at
`http://localhost:3000/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger` with the seeded
LockBit 3.0 ransomware investigation already in flight.

## Supported platforms

| OS | Package manager | Tested versions |
|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ubuntu / Debian | `apt` | 22.04, 24.04, Debian 12 |
| Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / Alma | `dnf` | Fedora 39+, RHEL 9, Rocky 9, Alma 9 |
| Arch / Manjaro | `pacman` | rolling |
| openSUSE Leap / Tumbleweed | `zypper` | 15.5+, Tumbleweed |
| Alpine | `apk` | 3.19+ |
| macOS | `brew` (auto-installed) | 13 Ventura, 14 Sonoma, 15 Sequoia (Apple Silicon + Intel) |
| Windows 10 / 11 | `winget` | Pro, Home, Enterprise |

The installer auto-detects the OS and picks the correct package manager.
Re-running is safe: every step is idempotent and short-circuits if the
target component is already installed at a sufficient version.

## What gets installed

### Linux + macOS (`install.sh`)

1.  **`git`** — required to clone the repo. Skipped if already on PATH.
2.  **Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2** (Linux) or **Docker Desktop**
    (macOS via Homebrew cask). On Linux the script enables and starts
    the `docker` service, then adds the invoking user to the `docker`
    group with a one-shot `sg docker -c …` so you don't have to log
    out and back in for the same install run.
3.  **Node.js 20 LTS** via the official NodeSource APT repo, the Fedora
    NodeJS module, the relevant native package on Arch / openSUSE /
    Alpine, or `brew install node@20` on macOS.
4.  **pnpm 8+** via `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest`.
5.  **Homebrew** (macOS only) — bootstrapped non-interactively if it
    isn't already installed.
6.  **The AiSOC repo itself** — cloned to `$HOME/aisoc` (override with
    `AISOC_DIR=/path/to/clone`). On a re-run the installer does
    `git fetch && git pull` instead.
7.  **`pnpm install`** at the repo root to materialise the workspace.
8.  **`pnpm aisoc:demo`** — the existing one-shot orchestrator that
    pulls the prebuilt `ghcr.io/beenuar/*` images, brings up the slim
    demo profile, runs the seeder as a one-shot container, kicks off
    an investigation, and opens your browser at the live case.

### Windows (`install.ps1`)

1.  **`winget`** must be present (it ships with Windows 10 21H2+ and
    all Windows 11 builds; the script tells you what to install if
    your machine is older than that).
2.  **`git`** via `winget install --id Git.Git`.
3.  **WSL2** — if Docker Desktop isn't already installed, the script
    enables the `Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux` and
    `VirtualMachinePlatform` features and sets WSL2 as the default
    version. A reboot is required after WSL2 is first enabled; the
    script tells you exactly when to reboot and which command to
    re-run after sign-in.
4.  **Docker Desktop** via `winget install --id Docker.DockerDesktop`.
    The script waits for the Docker Engine socket to come up before
    proceeding.
5.  **Node.js 20 LTS** via `winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`.
6.  **pnpm 8+** via `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest`.
7.  **The AiSOC repo** — cloned to `$env:USERPROFILE\aisoc` (override
    with `-AisocDir 'C:\path\to\clone'`).
8.  **`pnpm install`** + **`pnpm aisoc:demo`** as on Linux/macOS.

## Common cases

### "I already have everything installed"

That's fine. The installer is idempotent — it detects existing
sufficient versions and skips them. The end state is the same: a
running demo with `INC-RT-001` open in your browser.

### "I want to install into a different directory"

```bash
# Linux/macOS — clone to ~/work/aisoc instead of ~/aisoc:
AISOC_DIR=$HOME/work/aisoc bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.sh)
```

```powershell
# Windows — clone to D:\src\aisoc instead of $HOME\aisoc:
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.ps1 -OutFile $env:TEMP\aisoc-install.ps1
& $env:TEMP\aisoc-install.ps1 -AisocDir 'D:\src\aisoc'
```

### "I want to run the script after reading it"

Recommended for production-adjacent machines. Both scripts live at the
repo root and are short enough to read in one sitting:

- [`install.sh`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/blob/main/install.sh) — Linux + macOS (~620 lines, pure POSIX-friendly bash)
- [`install.ps1`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/blob/main/install.ps1) — Windows PowerShell

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.sh
less install.sh         # read it
shellcheck install.sh   # optional: confirm it's lint-clean
bash install.sh
```

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
notepad install.ps1     # read it
.\install.ps1
```

### "I want to skip the demo launch and just install dependencies"

```bash
# Linux/macOS:
AISOC_SKIP_DEMO=1 bash install.sh

# Windows:
.\install.ps1 -SkipDemo
```

The repo is still cloned and `pnpm install` still runs, but
`pnpm aisoc:demo` is skipped so you can manually configure `.env` /
secrets / connectors before the first stack startup.

### "I want to redirect the demo to a different host or port"

Edit `.env` after the clone step. The relevant variables are documented
inline in `.env.example` and in
[Deployment → Environment variables](./deployment/env-vars).

## Uninstall

Both installers ship with a matching uninstaller, also at the repo root.
They are graduated — by default they only stop the demo stack and drop
its named volumes, leaving Docker Desktop, Node, pnpm, and the repo
untouched. Pass flags to escalate.

| Action | Linux / macOS | Windows |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Stop stack + drop volumes | `./uninstall.sh` | `.\uninstall.ps1` |
| Also remove pulled images (~3 GB) | `./uninstall.sh --images` | `.\uninstall.ps1 -Images` |
| Also delete `node_modules` | `./uninstall.sh --node-modules` | `.\uninstall.ps1 -NodeModules` |
| Also delete the repo clone | `./uninstall.sh --repo` | `.\uninstall.ps1 -Repo` |
| Everything except shared deps | `./uninstall.sh --all` | `.\uninstall.ps1 -All` |
| Skip confirmation prompts | `./uninstall.sh --all --yes` | `.\uninstall.ps1 -All -Yes` |

The uninstaller intentionally **does not** remove Docker, Docker
Desktop, Node, pnpm, Homebrew, WSL2, or git — those are general-purpose
tools that other apps on your machine likely depend on. Remove them
manually if you really want a clean wipe.

## Troubleshooting

### `curl: command not found` (fresh Alpine container)

```sh
apk add --no-cache curl bash
```

Then re-run the one-liner.

### "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon" on the first run (Linux)

The installer has just added you to the `docker` group, but the
*current shell* still uses your old group set. The installer works around
this by running its own follow-up Docker commands through `sg docker -c …`.
For your **next interactive shell** to pick up the new group, log out and
back in (or `newgrp docker`).

### "Hyper-V is not enabled" on Windows Home

Windows Home doesn't include Hyper-V; Docker Desktop relies on the
WSL2 backend instead. The installer enables WSL2 automatically and
Docker Desktop will use it. If Docker Desktop still complains, open
`Settings → General` and confirm "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is
ticked, then `wsl --update` and restart Docker Desktop.

### Browser didn't open

Visit
[`http://localhost:3000/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger`](http://localhost:3000/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger)
manually. Default credentials are pre-filled (`demo@tryaisoc.com`); the
investigation is already in flight on the **Ledger** tab.

### `aisoc:demo` is already running

The orchestrator is idempotent — re-running `pnpm aisoc:demo` against
a healthy stack is a no-op. To get a fully clean start:

```bash
pnpm aisoc:demo:down   # stop stack + drop volumes
pnpm aisoc:demo        # bring it back up + reseed
```

### Anything else

The [troubleshooting page](./operations/troubleshooting) has runbooks
for the most common stack-level failure modes (healthchecks red,
Postgres OOM, Kafka cluster-id drift, …). For installer-specific bugs,
file an issue with the installer's full output —
[github.com/aisoc/aisoc/issues](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/issues).

## Security notes

- Both installers run as **your user**, not root. They invoke `sudo`
  only for package-manager calls on Linux. macOS Homebrew prompts for
  a password the first time it touches `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local`.
- The Linux script does **not** disable SELinux, AppArmor, or your
  firewall. The demo binds only to `127.0.0.1`, so nothing is exposed
  to your LAN by default.
- The Windows script enables WSL2 and starts Docker Desktop. It does
  **not** join AD, change Defender settings, or reconfigure Windows
  Update.
- The Docker images pulled by the demo
  (`ghcr.io/aisoc/aisoc-*`) are signed with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/);
  the [Docker deployment page](./deployment/docker#image-provenance)
  documents the signature verification workflow.
- The demo seeds **synthetic data only**. No real customer data, IOCs,
  or telemetry is shipped with the installer.
- The repo is cloned over HTTPS from `github.com/aisoc/aisoc` —
  there is no opaque "phone home" URL involved.
