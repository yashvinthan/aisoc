"""Pin the SQLAlchemy pool settings that keep Fly Postgres usable.

Without ``pool_pre_ping`` the pool hands out sockets the managed Postgres
already closed (autostop / idle teardown). The next query then raises
``asyncpg.exceptions.ConnectionDoesNotExistError``, which is what was
500ing every demo endpoint on tryaisoc.com while ``/health`` still looked
fine. These tests are import-free (parse the source) so they run in the
same lightweight CI job as the schema-drift guards — no full API dep set
required.
