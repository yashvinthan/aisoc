# Security policy

AiSOC is security software, so we take vulnerabilities in our own stack seriously. This document explains how to report issues responsibly and what to expect from us.

## Threat models

- Agent + tool surface (prompt injection, tool abuse): [`docs/security/agent-threat-model.md`](docs/security/agent-threat-model.md).
- Platform + credential vault (KMS envelope encryption, key rotation): [`docs/security/platform-threat-model.md`](docs/security/platform-threat-model.md).
- Connector least-privilege scopes: [`docs/security/connector-least-privilege.md`](docs/security/connector-least-privilege.md).

## Supported versions

| Version | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Active development. Security fixes land here first. |
| Latest tagged release | Receives critical fixes for **90 days** after release. |
| Older tagged releases | Best-effort only. We strongly recommend upgrading. |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue or PR for security problems.

Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/security/advisories/new) to send us a report directly. Include as much detail as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce, ideally a minimal proof of concept
- Affected version, commit SHA, or container digest
- Your name / handle if you'd like to be credited

If GitHub's reporting flow is not workable for your situation, you can instead reach the maintainers through the [SECURITY contact in the repository profile](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc). Please request our PGP key in your first message and we'll respond out-of-band before you send sensitive details (payloads, tokens, customer data).

## What to expect

| Window | What we do |
| --- | --- |
| **Within 48 hours** | Acknowledge receipt and assign a primary contact. |
| **Within 7 days** | Provide an initial triage: severity, scope, mitigation status. |
| **Within 30 days** | Ship a fix, advisory, or a clear timeline if more work is required. |
| **On disclosure** | Coordinate a public advisory and credit the reporter (if desired). |

We follow [coordinated disclosure](https://www.first.org/cvss/) and assign CVSS v3.1 scores in our advisories.

## Scope

In scope:

- Source in this repository (services, web, infra, integrations, packages)
- Official Docker images published from this repository
- Default Helm chart and Terraform modules in `infra/`

Out of scope:

- Third-party services that AiSOC integrates with (CrowdStrike, Splunk, AWS, etc.)
- Self-hosted deployments that have been customized
- Issues requiring physical access to a host

## Hardening guidance

If you operate AiSOC, please review:

- [`docs/runbooks/HARDENING.md`](docs/runbooks/HARDENING.md) for production hardening steps
- [`infra/helm/aisoc/values.yaml`](infra/helm/aisoc/values.yaml) for the security-related defaults
- [`services/api/app/core/security.py`](services/api/app/core/security.py) and [`services/api/app/auth/`](services/api/app/auth/) for our auth, RBAC, and SSO primitives
- [`services/api/app/middleware/`](services/api/app/middleware/) for rate limiting, audit logging, and request hardening

## Federated Threat Intel Mesh disclosure

The mesh (`services/mesh/`) is **opt-in** and privacy-preserving by design. It
shares only hashed IOC sightings (`SHA-256` of the normalized indicator — never
the raw value) and aggregate verdict signatures (category + connector +
technique + verdict distribution — never entities, tenant data, or free text).
Privacy is enforced by k-anonymity (consensus revealed only at `>= k` distinct
instances, default 5), per-instance Ed25519 signing (so one actor can't inflate
consensus), tenant/rule-level opt-out, and an outbound audit log; `mesh preview`
shows the exact payload before sharing is enabled. The full threat model is in
[`docs/architecture/mesh.md`](docs/architecture/mesh.md).

If you believe the mesh leaks more than the above (e.g. a raw IOC or entity is
recoverable from a shared artifact, k-anonymity can be bypassed, or a signature
can be forged), please treat it as a **high-severity** report and use private
vulnerability reporting — do not open a public issue.

## Bounty

AiSOC is an open-source project and does not currently operate a paid bounty program. We deeply appreciate responsible security reports.
