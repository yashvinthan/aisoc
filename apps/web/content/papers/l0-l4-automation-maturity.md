abstract: |
  Security Operations Centers are caught between two failure modes. Run all
  response through a human queue and the median time-to-respond is bounded
  by analyst attention, not by the speed of the attack. Hand the queue to
  an autonomous agent and a single false-positive can disable an
  executive's account, blackhole production traffic, or quarantine a CI
  build server during a release. The L0–L4 SOC Automation Maturity model,
  shipped as a first-class configuration in the open-source AiSOC platform,
  formalises the spectrum between these failure modes into five tiers. At
  each tier, a precise set of action blast radii is permitted to execute
  autonomously; everything else is queued for human approval. The tier is
  a row in a database, the gate is a function call on every action, and
  the decision is an audit-log entry. This paper documents the model,
  shows worked examples at every tier, explains how to assess your SOC's
  current tier, and discusses where the industry is heading.

# The L0–L4 SOC Automation Maturity Model

_A pragmatic framework for graduating autonomous response, with audit trails._

## Executive summary

Modern SOCs face two structural problems at once. The first is **volume**:
mature detections, broader telemetry, and more sources of truth produce
more alerts than analysts can read, let alone investigate. The second is
**trust**: the same agentic tooling that could absorb the volume is, in
practice, gated by every operator's reasonable refusal to grant blanket
autonomy to a system that could disable a CEO's account, isolate a
production database host, or block egress for an entire VPC at 2 a.m. on a
Sunday.

Most autonomy-vs-volume discussions collapse the question into a single
dial: _is the SOC autonomous, yes or no?_ That framing is wrong. It
encourages overclaiming on one side (_"fully autonomous response"_ usually
means _"fully autonomous notifications"_) and underdelivery on the other
(_"human-in-the-loop on every action"_ usually means _"the same analyst
queue you had five years ago, now with chatbots"_).

The L0–L4 SOC Automation Maturity model breaks the dial into five
positions, each defined by exactly two things:

1. The **blast radius** of an action — `MINIMAL`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`,
   or `CRITICAL`.
2. The **set of blast radii** that are permitted to execute autonomously
   at this tier; everything outside that set is routed to the human
   approval queue, and everything inside the set is logged on execution.

The five tiers are:

- **L0 — Observe.** The agent reasons, recommends, and drafts. It does
  not execute. Every action is queued for analyst approval.
- **L1 — Notify.** The agent is permitted to execute `MINIMAL` actions —
  notifications, tickets, ChatOps user verification, read-only SIEM
  searches — autonomously.
- **L2 — Contain.** The agent is permitted to execute `MINIMAL` and `LOW`
  actions — file quarantine, IOC blocklist, AV scan, forensics capture.
  This is where most production deployments land today.
- **L3 — Remediate.** The agent is permitted to execute `MEDIUM` actions
  — block IP/domain, kill process, reset password, force MFA, run a
  playbook — in addition to L2's scope. Human review is retrospective.
- **L4 — Automate.** The agent is permitted to execute `HIGH`-radius
  actions — host isolation, account disablement, session suspension,
  remote script execution — but **only** when the (action, target) pair
  matches a per-tenant whitelist entry with explicit constraints.

This paper documents the model precisely enough that an operator can
choose a tier, an auditor can verify the choice, and an engineer can
contribute new action types without breaking the gate. It is also,
deliberately, an opinionated document: it argues that any vendor's claim
of "autonomous SOC" is incomplete without a published, audited, per-action
gate, and it shows what such a gate looks like in code.

## Why a maturity model

### The case against a single autonomy switch

The simplest model of SOC automation is binary: either the agent fires
actions, or it doesn't. The problem with binary is that it forces
operators into one of three positions, none of which are defensible:

1. **All-manual.** Everything goes through the human queue. The
   alert-to-incident ratio is irrelevant because the alert-to-action ratio
   is bounded by analyst working hours. MTTR ceilings are measured in
   minutes for the lucky shift and hours for the unlucky one. This is the
   status quo for the majority of SOCs as of 2026.
2. **All-auto with vendor-defined safety rails.** Everything fires
   automatically, gated by whatever the platform considers safe. The
   operator doesn't choose the rails; the rails are a marketing
   commitment. False positives are the platform's fault. This is the
   "autonomous SOC" claim made by most autonomy-forward vendors. It is
   accurate for narrow demos and inaccurate for production tenants.
3. **All-auto with feature flags.** Everything fires automatically, but
   operators can disable specific actions. This is a per-flag approval
   system, not a maturity model. It scales linearly in operator
   attention: 30 action types means 30 flags to reason about.

None of these models give an operator a single coherent answer to
"what is my SOC allowed to do autonomously today, and what changes when I
flip a single switch?"

### The case for action blast radius as the unit of trust

The insight underlying L0–L4 is that **operator trust is granted per action
class, not per product.** Operators have stable, defensible intuitions
about action blast radius:

- Sending a Slack message about an alert is not the same as quarantining
  a file.
- Quarantining a file is not the same as resetting a password.
- Resetting a password is not the same as isolating a host.
- Isolating a host is not the same as disabling a user account on the
  identity provider.

Each step up that ladder represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the
cost of a false positive. A wrong Slack message costs attention. A wrong
file quarantine costs an analyst's morning. A wrong host isolation costs
a developer's day. A wrong account disablement costs a meeting and
sometimes a contract.

Operators don't trust products. They trust _specific products to take
specific action classes against specific targets._ A maturity model
encodes that intuition as a small set of tiers; the per-action whitelist
encodes the (target, constraint) fine-grain at the top tier.

### The case for a written, audited gate

The third design choice is that the gate must be **inspectable in code and
audit-loggable per fire.** Operators must be able to read the gate
function, look at the gate log for the last 24 hours, and form a verifiable
belief about what the agent did and didn't do. Without this, the maturity
model is just marketing.

In AiSOC, the gate is a single function — `evaluate_gate(request, config)`
in `services/actions/app/services/maturity.py` — that returns one of
`auto`, `queued_approval`, or `blocked`, along with a structured rationale.
Every decision is written to `remediation_gate_log` with the tier, blast
radius, action type, target, and human-readable explanation. This log is
queryable via `/api/v1/remediation/gate-log` and is the source of truth
for tier-graduation conversations.

## The five tiers in detail

### L0 — Observe

L0 is the safe-by-default position. The agent stack runs at full
capability — it triages alerts, enriches observables, correlates across
sources, drafts case notes, suggests playbooks, and proposes actions —
but it never executes. Every action a playbook, recommendation, or human
operator requests is routed to the approval queue.

**Entry criteria.** A working AiSOC tenant with at least one connector
emitting alerts. No special trust signals required. L0 is the default for
new tenants and for tenants in regulated environments where the
compliance team needs an audit window before any autonomous action is
permitted.

**What is auto-executed.** Nothing.

**What is gated.** Every action, regardless of blast radius. The
approval queue is the operating mode.

**MTTR target.** Bounded by human attention. The agent cannot reduce
median MTTR below the time it takes an analyst to read an alert, evaluate
the suggested actions, and click approve. For high-volume tenants, MTTR
at L0 is functionally identical to MTTR before AiSOC was deployed; the
agent buys investigation depth, not response speed.

**FP tolerance.** Very high. Because no autonomous action fires, false
positives carry only the cost of analyst attention.

**Honest characterisation.** L0 is a starting position, not a destination.
SOCs that stay at L0 forever are getting only a fraction of the value an
autonomous agent provides. But operators who skip L0 entirely — who turn
on autonomous response before they've reviewed a single agent
recommendation — are setting up for a high-cost false-positive event
that destroys trust faster than any feature can rebuild it.

### L1 — Notify

L1 is the first tier where the agent fires actions autonomously. The
permitted actions all share a single property: their only side effect is
information movement, not infrastructure mutation.

**Entry criteria.** The tenant has wired at least one notification
connector — Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or an ITSM connector for
ticket creation — and has opted into L1 explicitly via the
`/api/v1/remediation/config` endpoint.

**What is auto-executed.** `notify_slack`, `create_ticket`,
`chatops_verify`, `search_siem`. These are the `MINIMAL`-blast-radius
actions defined in `ACTION_BLAST_RADIUS`.

**What is gated.** Every `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `HIGH` action is queued.

**MTTR target.** Time-to-notify drops from minutes to seconds; time-to-
contain is still bounded by human review. For the most common case —
analyst gets paged, reads the agent's draft, approves the suggested
containment — L1 trims the page-to-read step from "minutes of dashboard
hunting" to "seconds of reading a structured Slack message."

**FP tolerance.** Medium-high. A wrong Slack post is recoverable and
embarrassing. A wrong ticket gets closed in two clicks. ChatOps
verification of a user is itself a feedback signal — if the user says
"that wasn't me," the case escalates and the false positive becomes a
true positive.

**Honest characterisation.** L1 is the floor for any production SOC
deployment. Tenants that don't reach L1 within their first deployment
cycle should treat that as a deployment problem, not a maturity problem.

### L2 — Contain

L2 is where AiSOC's median production tenant operates. The agent is
permitted to execute reversible, single-resource, low-impact containment
actions in addition to L1's notification scope.

**Entry criteria.** The tenant has been at L1 long enough to accumulate a
sample of agent-suggested decisions (usually one deployment cycle, or
"a couple of weeks of real alert volume"). The operator has reviewed the
gate log, sampled the agent's reasoning, and is satisfied with the
false-positive rate. The rollback semantics in
`services/actions/app/executors/` for each LOW action have been read and
accepted.

**What is auto-executed.** Everything at L1 plus: `quarantine_file`,
`capture_forensics`, `add_ioc_to_blocklist`, `run_av_scan`,
`create_notable_event`.

**What is gated.** Everything `MEDIUM` and above is queued.

**MTTR target.** MTTR for the auto-execution path drops to single-digit
minutes end-to-end. The bulk of AiSOC's published benchmark numbers come
from L2-tier tenants, because that is where the platform's autonomous
behaviour first becomes load-bearing.

**FP tolerance.** Medium. A wrongly-quarantined file is recoverable from
the gate log: the rollback metadata in `ActionRequest.rollback_data` is
designed so an analyst can release the quarantine in a single API call.
A wrongly-blocked IOC has a similar rollback path. The cost is analyst
time, not user disruption.

**Honest characterisation.** When a prospect asks "where is AiSOC
autonomous today," the truthful answer is "L2 for the median tenant,
L3 on selected action classes for mature tenants." Anyone marketing a
higher number is either running a narrow demo, counting recommendations
as actions, or describing a roadmap.

### L3 — Remediate

L3 expands the agent's autonomous scope to `MEDIUM`-blast-radius actions
— actions that affect a single resource but whose impact is more visible
than file quarantine.

**Entry criteria.** The tenant has been at L2 for an extended period
with a satisfactory false-positive rate. For each MEDIUM action class the
tenant intends to enable, the rollback story is tested end-to-end:
"a wrongly-fired `reset_password` can be undone in N minutes via the
following API call." ITSM integration is live so the agent's
retrospective audit trail lands on the analyst's queue automatically.
Compliance has reviewed and accepted that the agent's actions are
auditable in `remediation_gate_log` and in connector-native logs (e.g.
firewall rule changes are auditable on the firewall, password resets are
auditable in the IdP audit log).

**What is auto-executed.** Everything at L2 plus: `block_ip`,
`block_domain`, `kill_process`, `reset_password`, `force_mfa`,
`run_playbook`, `allow_ip`, `block_ioc`, `sync_detection_rule`,
`update_watcher`.

**What is gated.** Everything `HIGH` is queued.

**MTTR target.** MTTR for `MEDIUM` actions drops below five minutes on
well-instrumented connectors. The analyst's role shifts from
prospective ("should the agent act?") to retrospective ("was the agent
right?").

**FP tolerance.** Low-to-medium. A wrong password reset interrupts a
real user. A wrong DNS block interrupts a real service. Rollback is
supported but not free; the cost is measured in user-visible disruption
plus analyst recovery time.

**Honest characterisation.** L3 is not a binary upgrade from L2. In
practice, AiSOC tenants reach L3 _per action type_ rather than as a
global tier bump. The recommended path is to set the tenant tier to L2
and use `force_auto` overrides on specific MEDIUM action types (e.g.
`block_ip` for known-malicious IPs from high-confidence threat intel)
while leaving the rest of the MEDIUM tier in the approval queue. This
keeps the tier setting honest and surface-visible.

### L4 — Automate

L4 is the highest tier, and it is the most operationally demanding.
The agent is permitted to execute `HIGH`-blast-radius actions — host
isolation, user disablement, session suspension, remote script execution
— **only** when the (action, target) combination matches a whitelist
entry in `remediation_whitelist`.

The whitelist is the operator's way of saying:

> _"For these specific action types, applied to these specific target
> patterns, I have pre-approved autonomous execution. For everything
> else at HIGH radius, queue it like you would at L3."_

The whitelist supports constraints on the action's target — for example,
`target_prefix: "10.0.0."` constrains an `isolate_host` whitelist entry
to internal IP ranges only. Expiry is supported via the `expires_at`
column so an L4 whitelist entry can be time-bounded (a 24-hour
"isolate hosts in the breached subnet" automation during an incident).

**Entry criteria.** The tenant has been at L3 for an extended period
with a clean gate log. The operator has at least one closed-loop
scenario where the (action, target) combination is provably safe — the
canonical example being `isolate_host` on workstations tagged
`quarantine-eligible` in the asset inventory. The whitelist entry has
explicit constraints, an expiry date, and a ChatOps notification path so
every fire reaches a human within minutes.

**What is auto-executed.** Everything at L3 plus, _for whitelisted
(action, target) combinations only:_ `isolate_host`, `disable_user`,
`suspend_session`, `run_script`. Any HIGH-radius action that does not
match a whitelist entry falls back to `queued_approval` exactly as it
would at L3.

**What is gated.** Every HIGH-radius action without a matching whitelist
entry. Every `CRITICAL`-radius action regardless of tier (no whitelist
override is possible for CRITICAL).

**MTTR target.** For the whitelisted closed loops, MTTR drops below two
minutes end-to-end. The agent owns the response; the human reviews at
audit time.

**FP tolerance.** Very low for whitelisted actions. The whitelist is the
operator's signed contract that this specific combination has been
de-risked, with rollback, notification, and expiry built in.

**Honest characterisation.** As of v8.0, a small number of pilot AiSOC
tenants are operating closed-loop L4 automations for narrow scenarios
(host isolation on quarantine-tagged workstations, session suspension on
tokens from impossible-travel events). The platform supports L4 fully,
but the operator burden of building, testing, and maintaining the
whitelist is high enough that "L4 by default" is not a goal. The goal is
"L4 for the actions that deserve L4, L3 for the rest."

## How the gate evaluates an action

For every action a playbook, agent, or human submits,
`evaluate_gate(request, config)` runs the following decision tree. This
is the actual code path, reproduced here so the model is unambiguous.

```text
1. Look up the action's blast radius from ACTION_BLAST_RADIUS.
2. Look up the tenant's tier and per-action overrides from
   the tenant's RemediationMaturity row.
3. If action_overrides[action_type] has block=true:
     → decision = "blocked"; record rationale; stop.
4. If action_overrides[action_type] has force_auto=true:
     → decision = "auto" with overrides_applied=["force_auto_override"];
       record rationale; stop.
5. If blast_radius == HIGH and tier == L4:
     a. Scan remediation_whitelist for an entry matching this
        action_type and target_prefix.
     b. If no match: decision = "queued_approval"; stop.
     c. If match: continue, with overrides_applied=["whitelist:<id>"].
6. Compare blast_radius against the tier's allow-set:
     L0 = {}
     L1 = {MINIMAL}
     L2 = {MINIMAL, LOW}
     L3 = {MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM}
     L4 = {MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH}
     (CRITICAL is never in any allow-set.)
7. If blast_radius is in the allow-set: decision = "auto".
   Else: decision = "queued_approval".
8. Record the decision to remediation_gate_log with tier,
   action_type, blast_radius, decision, rationale, actor.
```

Every decision — `auto`, `queued_approval`, or `blocked` — is logged.
The `actor` field is `system` for agent-initiated actions and the user
UUID for human-initiated ones; the gate runs uniformly regardless.

## How to assess your SOC's current tier

These are the questions AiSOC's onboarding flow asks. They are the same
questions a security architect should ask before flipping the tier dial.

1. **Notification readiness.** Is at least one notification connector
   configured and actively read? If the agent's Slack post falls in an
   abandoned channel, L1 buys nothing. Verdict: stay at L0 until
   notifications are real.
2. **Alert-to-incident ratio.** AiSOC's public benchmark gates at 50:1.
   Tenants with a higher ratio will amplify noise, not reduce it, when
   the agent starts firing autonomously. Verdict: stay at L1.
3. **Rollback discipline.** For each LOW-blast-radius action class you
   intend to auto-fire, is the rollback documented and tested? File
   quarantine release is trivial; IOC blocklist removal is one API call.
   If you've never tested a release, you'll learn the hard way.
   Verdict: stay at L1 until rollback is real.
4. **Gate log review cadence.** Is there a person or scheduled job that
   reviews the last 24 hours of `/api/v1/remediation/gate-log` every
   morning? If no, L3 is operationally dangerous. Verdict: stay at L2.
5. **Whitelist hygiene.** For L4, do you have at least one specific
   (action, target) combination with constraints, expiry, and a
   notification path? Have you mapped the rollback story end-to-end?
   Verdict: stay at L3.

The honest answer for most SOCs as of 2026 is that they are at L0 with an
ambitious roadmap to L2. The honest answer for most AiSOC tenants as of
v8.0 is that they are at L2 with selective L3 overrides on specific
high-confidence action types.

## Migration paths

Tiers should move gradually and reversibly.

```text
L0 → L1
  - Wire at least one notification connector.
  - Read the gate log after a full alert cycle.
  - PUT /api/v1/remediation/config { "maturity_tier": 1 }.

L1 → L2
  - Run at L1 for one deployment cycle (typically 2–4 weeks).
  - Sample the gate log; confirm the agent's recommended LOW actions
    would have been correct.
  - Read and accept rollback semantics for each LOW action class.
  - PUT /api/v1/remediation/config { "maturity_tier": 2 }.

L2 → L3 (recommended path: per-action, not global)
  - Identify a specific MEDIUM action class with high-confidence input
    (e.g. block_ip when threat intel confidence > 0.95).
  - Add { "force_auto": true } to action_overrides for that action class.
  - Keep the tier at L2.
  - After several weeks with a clean gate log on that action class,
    add another. Promote the tier only when most MEDIUM action classes
    are already auto-approved via overrides.

L3 → L4
  - Identify one closed-loop scenario (action_type, target_prefix).
  - Add a whitelist entry with explicit constraints, expiry, and
    ChatOps notification on every fire.
  - Run the loop for an incident or a quarterly fire drill.
  - Promote the tier to L4 only when the whitelist is exercised and
    reviewed in production.
```

The dial moves both ways. A tier drop is a single API call away. AiSOC
treats tier _downgrades_ — for example, dropping back to L2 during a
sensitive period such as a financial audit or after a recent operational
incident — as a normal, lossless operation. The gate picks up the new
tier on the next action with no service restart.

## Open questions and where the industry is heading

The maturity model is not a finished artefact. Several open questions
will shape it over the next 12–24 months.

**1. Per-target trust at L3.** L4 has whitelist-level fine-grain via
target prefix constraints; L3 does not. There is a credible argument for
extending whitelist-style constraints down to L3 so a tenant can say
"auto-fire `block_ip` for sources in known-malicious feeds but queue
auto-fires against private RFC1918 ranges." This would replace the
current `force_auto` boolean with a constraint object; the cost is a
modest schema change on `action_overrides`.

**2. Tier-aware playbooks.** AiSOC's playbook engine currently does not
parameterise its steps by the executing tenant's tier. A playbook author
who wants step 4 to "fire if tier ≥ L3, else queue" must encode that
conditional in the playbook itself. A future revision may let playbooks
declare a per-step minimum tier and let the engine route accordingly,
making playbooks portable across tenants at different tiers.

**3. Tier as a marketplace property.** Plugins in the AiSOC marketplace
declare which action types they offer. A future revision could let
plugins declare a recommended _minimum tier_ for their actions, so
operators see at install time whether the new connector's actions fit
the tenant's current automation posture.

**4. Tier as a compliance artefact.** Some regulated environments
(financial services, healthcare, government) need a sworn statement of
"what could the agent have done autonomously during this incident
window." `remediation_gate_log` is a partial answer, but a more
auditor-friendly export — tier history, whitelist diff, override diff,
gate log — would close the loop. The compliance evidence export at
`/api/v1/compliance` is the likely home for this.

**5. Cross-vendor reversibility taxonomy.** Action blast radius is
currently a project-internal taxonomy. The MITRE D3FEND defensive
technique catalog and the OASIS CACAO action vocabularies do not encode
blast radius. There is a credible case for proposing a shared taxonomy
to those communities so that "this CACAO action is HIGH blast radius"
is a portable claim across implementations.

The bigger industry shift the model anticipates is the move from
_autonomous SOC_ as a marketing tier to _per-action autonomy_ as the
default vocabulary. The vendor that says "we are L4 on these six action
types and L2 on the rest, here is the gate log" is more credible than the
vendor that says "we are autonomous." Operators are catching up; auditors
are ahead of operators; regulators are starting to ask.

## References and further reading

The model is informed by, but not aligned to, the following industry
frameworks:

- **MITRE D3FEND.** The defensive-technique catalog organises responses
  by mechanism (isolate, evict, restrict, restore). The D3FEND mechanism
  hierarchy maps roughly onto AiSOC's blast-radius taxonomy: `restrict`
  techniques tend to be `LOW`/`MEDIUM`, `isolate` and `evict` techniques
  tend to be `HIGH`. The mapping is not 1:1 — D3FEND is about technique
  identity, AiSOC is about operational impact — but the framings rhyme.
  See: <https://d3fend.mitre.org/>.

- **OASIS CACAO.** The Collaborative Automated Course of Action
  Operations specification (v2.0) is the open-standard format for
  describing playbooks across security platforms. AiSOC's playbook
  engine is format-compatible with CACAO v2.0, which means a CACAO
  playbook can be loaded by the engine and gated by the L0–L4 model
  exactly as a native AiSOC playbook would be. See:
  <https://www.oasis-open.org/standard/cacao/>.

- **SAE J3016 (driving automation levels).** The automotive industry's
  five-tier model for driving automation (L0 monitoring only through L5
  fully autonomous) is the original "level model" for human-AI shared
  responsibility. The analogy to SOC operations is loose — security
  actions are largely reversible while driving actions are not — but
  the framing of "who is responsible at each tier" is portable, and the
  L0–L4 naming is a deliberate echo. See:
  <https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/>.

- **NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide).** The
  classical four-phase incident response lifecycle (preparation,
  detection and analysis, containment-eradication-recovery, post-incident
  activity) maps onto the AiSOC tier model: L0/L1 belong to detection
  and analysis, L2/L3 belong to containment and eradication, L4 closed
  loops belong to fully-instrumented recovery. See:
  <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final>.

## Appendix A — Tier-by-tier comparison table

| Property | L0 | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 |
|---------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Auto-execute MINIMAL | no | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Auto-execute LOW | no | no | yes | yes | yes |
| Auto-execute MEDIUM | no | no | no | yes | yes |
| Auto-execute HIGH | no | no | no | no | whitelisted only |
| Auto-execute CRITICAL | no | no | no | no | no |
| Required connectors | none | one notification | one notification + one containment | + one MEDIUM-class executor | + tested rollback at HIGH |
| Required process | analyst reads | analyst reads | analyst reviews gate log | analyst reviews gate log daily | whitelist owner reviews per fire |
| Typical MTTR ceiling | hours | minutes (notify) | minutes (contain) | minutes (remediate) | seconds–minutes (whitelist) |
| Typical FP cost | analyst attention | analyst attention | analyst time | user disruption | severe (mitigated by whitelist) |

## Appendix B — Worked example: closed-loop session suspension

A pilot tenant runs L3 for the tenant default and an L4 whitelist for a
single closed loop: _"Suspend the session token if AiSOC detects
impossible travel."_

The whitelist entry is:

```json
{
  "action_type": "suspend_session",
  "blast_radius": "high",
  "constraints": {
    "target_prefix": "session:"
  },
  "expires_at": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

When the impossible-travel detection fires and the agent submits a
`suspend_session` action against target `session:eyJhbGc...`, the gate
runs:

1. Blast radius is `HIGH`.
2. Tier is L4.
3. Whitelist scan finds the entry; `target_prefix` matches.
4. Decision: `auto`, with `overrides_applied=["whitelist:<entry-id>"]`.
5. Action executes against the IdP. Rollback metadata is captured.
6. A ChatOps message goes to the on-call channel within seconds.
7. The gate log row is queryable for retrospective review.

If the same agent had submitted `disable_user` (HIGH radius, no
whitelist entry), the gate would have returned `queued_approval` and the
action would have landed in the analyst queue.

This is the model in production. The dial moves slowly. The audit log is
always on. The operator owns the trust posture; AiSOC owns the gate.
