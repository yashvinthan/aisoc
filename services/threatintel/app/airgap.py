"""Air-gap egress enforcement for the threat-intel service.

Mirrors the policy implemented in ``services/api/app/core/airgap.py`` but
keeps the dependency surface small: this module reads from the local
``Settings`` and from ``os.environ`` so it can be imported from feed
handlers and the FeedScheduler without coupling them to the full API
service.

Design notes
------------
The threat-intel service is the single largest source of outbound HTTP
in the AiSOC stack — by default it polls AlienVault OTX, CISA KEV, one
or more TAXII servers, and (optionally) MISP / OpenCTI. In an
air-gapped deployment those public feeds must not be contacted at all,
not even to fail closed at request time, because (a) failed DNS to
``otx.alienvault.com`` still leaks the fact that an AiSOC instance
exists, and (b) repeated 30-minute polls produce a steady network
signal even if every request is rejected by an egress proxy.

So the contract here is intentionally stricter than the API service
contract: feeds whose configured URL is public are *refused at
registration time* when ``AISOC_AIRGAPPED=1``. Internal mirrors hosted
on private RFC1918 networks or on suffixes in ``AISOC_AIRGAP_ALLOWLIST``
are still allowed, so customers running an internal CISA KEV mirror or
their own MISP instance can use those without flipping any per-feed
flag.
