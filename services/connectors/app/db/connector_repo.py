"""Read/write access to the canonical ``connectors`` table.

The schema for that table lives in ``services/api/app/models/connector.py``;
the API service owns the migrations. We deliberately do **not** import that
ORM model here — it would drag the API's full app.* package into our import
graph. Instead we pin the column shape via SQLAlchemy Core ``Table``/
``MetaData`` against the same ``connectors`` table and limit ourselves to the
columns the scheduler needs.

If the API service ever changes the column shape in a backwards-incompatible
way, the scheduler will fail loudly at first poll (column not found), which is
what we want — silent drift between two services that share a table is the
worst possible failure mode.
