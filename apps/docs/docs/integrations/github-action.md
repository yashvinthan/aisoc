# `aisoc-action` — triage your repo's security signals in CI

`aisoc-action` runs the AiSOC **deterministic verdict engine** over your
repository's own security alerts — Dependabot, CodeQL (code scanning), and
secret scanning — and posts verdicts, suppression rationale, and prioritization
as a PR comment or job summary. No LLM, no data leaves your CI runner.

> **Status:** the Action is dogfooded on the AiSOC repo today via the in-repo
> path (`uses: ./packages/aisoc-action`). Publishing to the GitHub Marketplace
> as `beenuar/aisoc-action@v1` lands with the v8.0 launch.

## PR triage (comment on every pull request)

```yaml
name: security-triage
on:
  pull_request:
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: beenuar/aisoc-action@v1
        with:
          mode: pr-comment
          min-severity: low
```

You'll get a comment like:

> 🛡️ **AiSOC security triage** — 3 of 41 findings are prioritized as
> exploitable / act-now; 34 are low-signal noise.

with a table of the findings that need attention (verdict, confidence, source,
recommended action), and an idempotent update-in-place on subsequent pushes.

## Weekly posture digest (issue)

```yaml
name: security-posture
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '17 13 * * 1' # Mondays
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: read
  issues: write
jobs:
  digest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: beenuar/aisoc-action@v1
        with:
          mode: digest
```

Refreshes a single `aisoc-digest`-labelled issue each week with an A–F posture
grade and the week-over-week change in act-now findings.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `github-token` | `${{ github.token }}` | Needs `security-events: read`; `pull-requests: write` for comments; `issues: write` for the digest. |
| `mode` | `job-summary` | `job-summary` \| `pr-comment` \| `digest` |
| `min-severity` | `low` | Lowest severity to include (`info`→`critical`). |
| `fail-on` | `none` | Fail the job on `needs_review` or `true_positive` findings (gate mode). |
| `sources` | `dependabot,code-scanning,secret-scanning` | Which signals to pull. |

## Outputs

`total`, `escalate`, `review`, `suppress`, `headline` — wire them into
downstream steps.

## How it works

Each alert is normalized into the same `Alert` shape the CLI uses and scored by
the vendored, byte-for-byte copy of the CLI verdict engine (kept in sync by
`scripts/sync_vendored_verdict.py`). Runtime-scope Dependabot vulnerabilities
are prioritized as exploitable-in-your-dependency-graph. Sources that are
disabled or that the token can't read are skipped gracefully with a note — the
Action never hard-fails on a missing feature.
