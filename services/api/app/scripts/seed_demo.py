"""Seed the database with a realistic demo tenant, user, and SOC dataset.

Run this from the host (the API container has the package on its PYTHONPATH):

    docker compose exec api python -m app.scripts.seed_demo
    # or, from the repo root:
    pnpm seed:demo

The seed is idempotent — running it twice produces the same dataset and never
duplicates rows. Demo IDs are kept in sync with `app/api/v1/dev_auth.py` so the
auth bypass and the seeded data agree on who "demo@tryaisoc.com" is.

Two modes:

* **Full seed** (default) — populates the canonical BOTS-shaped catalogue:
  15 hand-crafted ``INC-RT-*`` incidents (with one in-flight investigation
  on INC-RT-001), 28 randomised alerts, and the supporting connector set.
  This is what ``pnpm aisoc:demo`` runs and what the hosted demo ships.

* **Quick seed** (``--demo-quick``) — populates exactly four deterministic
  cases (DEMO-001 phishing, DEMO-002 cloud takeover, DEMO-003 insider exfil,
  DEMO-004 ransomware) with a fixed wall-clock so re-runs are byte-stable.
  This is the T6.4 screencast path — ``pnpm aisoc:demo --quick`` finishes
  in under 4 minutes on a warm laptop. ``_purge_demo_quick`` deletes the
  four DEMO-* cases before reseeding so re-running is a clean reset rather
  than a duplicate.
