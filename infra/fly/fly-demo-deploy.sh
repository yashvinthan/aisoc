# fly-demo-deploy.sh
#
# Deploys the full AiSOC live demo stack to Fly.io behind tryaisoc.com.
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after partial failures.
#
# Usage:
#   ./infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh             # full deploy
#   ./infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh --provision # also creates Postgres + Upstash
#   ./infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh --skip-seed # don't run seeder after deploy
#
# Prereqs:
#   - flyctl installed and authed   (https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)
#   - FLY_ORG env var set, or override with --org=
#   - DNS for tryaisoc.com (and api., ws.) pointed at the Fly apps via CNAME.
#     The deploy script issues certs but DNS must be live for them to validate.
#
# Architecture:
#
#   tryaisoc.com       aisoc-demo-web      (Next.js UI)
#   api.tryaisoc.com   aisoc-demo-api      (FastAPI; /health, /docs, /api/v1/*)
#   ws.tryaisoc.com    aisoc-demo-realtime (WebSocket fanout)
#
#   web  api, agents, realtime (over Fly's *.internal 6PN DNS)
#   api  agents, realtime, Postgres, Redis
#
#   Postgres = Fly managed (aisoc-demo-postgres)
#   Redis    = Upstash via Fly (aisoc-demo-redis)
#
# Time-to-first-investigation budget: <60s from the tryaisoc.com click.
# The seed job pre-warms a running investigation so the deeplink lands
# inside its TTFI budget regardless of cold-start.

  # Upstash Redis on Fly.
  #
  # `flyctl redis create` is the *only* place Fly exposes the connection URL.
  # There's no `redis attach` subcommand and `redis status` doesn't print the
  # URL either, so we capture stdout and grep out the redis:// string. The
  # URL is then propagated to each consuming app via `flyctl secrets set`
  # (see attach_redis below).
  #
  # Plan choice: "Pay-as-you-go" is the cheapest tier ($0.2 / 100K cmds);
  # the older "Free" plan was retired in flyctl 0.4.x. Plan names are
  # case-sensitive: `flyctl redis plans` prints them with a capital P, and
  # passing the lowercase "pay-as-you-go" form returns
  # `Error: plan "pay-as-you-go" not found`.
  #
  # --enable-eviction picks the eviction policy non-interactively. Without
  # this, flyctl prompts ("Would you like to enable eviction?") and dies with
  # "Error: prompt: non interactive" inside scripted runs. We want eviction ON
  # for a demo cache: Upstash will drop old keys instead of refusing writes
  # when the tier fills up.
  #
  # ProdPack: flyctl 0.4.x added a new interactive prompt asking whether you
  # want the ProdPack add-on ($200/mo for enhanced production features).
  # There is no `--no-prodpack` flag (only `--enable-prodpack` to opt in),
  # so the prompt fires unconditionally in scripted runs and dies with
  # "Error: prompt: non interactive". We feed `n\n` on stdin to decline.
  # This is a "default no" prompt so a single newline would also work, but
  # being explicit makes the intent obvious to anyone reading the script.

#  deploy stack

#   3. realtime  web caller
#   4. web       last; serves traffic at tryaisoc.com
#
# The seeder is *not* a separate app  it ships inside the api image as
# `python -m app.scripts.seed_demo`, runs automatically on every deploy via
# `[deploy].release_command` in api/fly.toml, and is also wired up post-deploy
# (belt-and-suspenders for first-time deploys) plus on a daily scheduled
# machine for the 00:00 UTC refresh. This avoids a duplicate Dockerfile +
# the cost of a fifth Fly app whose only job is to run a 30-second script.

# Why we cd into the build context: the existing service Dockerfiles (api,
# agents, web, realtime) were written assuming the build context is the
# service source dir (they do `COPY pyproject.toml ./` and `COPY . .`).
# Fly's build context defaults to the *current working directory* of `flyctl
# deploy`, so we cd there before invoking it. The fly.toml is referenced by
# absolute path so flyctl still finds it.
# ensure_app creates a Fly app if it doesn't already exist. Required because
# `flyctl postgres attach` and `flyctl secrets set` both need the target app
# to exist *before* the secret can be written. Our flow stages secrets before
# the first deploy so the app boots with DATABASE_URL/REDIS_URL already
# populated, avoiding the cold-start path where the app comes up, fails to
# connect, and only gets the secret on a redeploy.
