.SYNOPSIS
    AiSOC — One-Click Installer for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Bootstraps a freshly-imaged Windows 10/11 machine to a running AiSOC
    dashboard in a single command. Zero assumed prerequisites.

    What this script does, in order:
        1. Verifies you're on Windows 10 (build 19041+) or Windows 11.
        2. Verifies WSL2 is enabled (required by Docker Desktop).
        3. Installs (idempotently) the four prerequisites AiSOC needs:
             - Git
             - Docker Desktop (which bundles Docker Engine + Compose v2)
             - Node.js 20 LTS
             - pnpm 8+ (via corepack)
           All installs go through winget, the official Windows package
           manager. We never download random installers from the internet.
        4. Clones the AiSOC repo (if you ran the script as a one-liner) or
           reuses it (if you ran .\install.ps1 from inside a clone).
        5. Creates a .env from .env.example so the first boot has sane
           defaults.
        6. Runs `pnpm install` to fetch the orchestrator's Node deps.
        7. Hands off to `pnpm aisoc:demo`, which pulls prebuilt images,
           brings up the slim demo profile, seeds the showcase ransomware
           case, and opens your browser at the case ledger view.

.PARAMETER NoInstall
    Skip the dependency-install phase (use what's on PATH).

.PARAMETER NoLaunch
    Set everything up but don't run pnpm aisoc:demo at the end.

.PARAMETER NoPull
    Forwarded to aisoc:demo to skip image pull.

.PARAMETER Rebuild
    Forwarded to aisoc:demo to build images from source.

.PARAMETER CloneDir
    Where to clone the repo when running as a one-liner. Default:
    $env:USERPROFILE\aisoc.

.PARAMETER Branch
    Git branch to clone. Default: main.

.PARAMETER SkipPreflight
    Skip the preflight checks (RAM, disk, network, ports, WSL2, Docker reach).
    Use only if you know exactly what you're doing — preflight catches >80%
    of "doesn't work for me" reports.

.PARAMETER Diagnose
    Run preflight checks and exit. No installs, no demo. Useful for triaging
    a half-broken machine without committing to a full install.

.PARAMETER NonInteractive
    Don't prompt for anything; refuse to do any step that needs user input
    (e.g. accepting Docker Desktop's EULA on first launch). Auto-enabled
    when stdin is redirected (iwr | iex) or when $env:CI is set.

.EXAMPLE
    # One-liner from PowerShell (run as your normal user, not Administrator —
    # winget will elevate per-package as needed):
    iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.ps1 | iex

.EXAMPLE
    # From inside a clone:
    .\install.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Custom clone directory and skip the launch:
    .\install.ps1 -CloneDir D:\code\aisoc -NoLaunch

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
        0  success — demo stack is up and your browser opened
        1  prerequisite install failed
        2  Docker Desktop refused to come up / WSL2 not enabled
        3  pnpm aisoc:demo failed (stack didn't boot or seed)
        4  preflight checks failed (machine doesn't meet minimums)
        5  git clone failed (network / branch / disk)

    Tested on:
        - Windows 11 23H2 (x64 + ARM64)
        - Windows 10 22H2 (x64)
        - Windows Server 2022 (x64; you must install Docker Desktop manually
          on Server SKUs — winget can't, server doesn't have the Store)

    The script is safe to re-run. Each install step checks "is this already
    present and the right version?" before doing anything.
