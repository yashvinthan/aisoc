// (jsdom) — no SSR, no Next.js server runtime. Anything that requires the
// full Next.js stack should live in an e2e suite (Playwright) instead.

// Phase 2.2 — coverage gating via v8 provider with explicit floors.
// Measured baseline at the time of introduction:
//   statements 58.08%, branches 51.86%, functions 50.96%, lines 60.08%.
// Floors are baseline minus ~3pp to absorb cherry-picked-test variance
// (a PR that touches only one component re-runs every test, but the
// edge-case branches in untouched code can drift slightly with prod
// dep bumps). Raise these numbers as the suite grows — never lower
// them without a written justification in the PR description.
