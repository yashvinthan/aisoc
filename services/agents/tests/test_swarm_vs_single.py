"""Swarm-vs-single eval gate (v8 P3).

Publishes both numbers and asserts the swarm beats single-agent mode on the
investigation-completeness macro by >= 10% while staying under a cost ceiling.

HONESTY: `investigation_completeness` here is a **substrate self-consistency**
macro — the fraction of an incident's relevant hypotheses that were considered.
A single agent pursues only its top prior; the swarm considers up to five, so on
genuinely multi-hypothesis incidents its completeness is structurally higher.
This is NOT a live-LLM accuracy claim (same framing as the rest of the eval
harness). The synthetic incident set is labelled synthetic.
