"""Static regression gate for the LLM input contract (T2.3).

Rule: nothing in ``services/agents/app/`` may call ``.ainvoke(...)`` or
``.astream(...)`` directly on an LLM. All LLM calls MUST go through
:func:`app.llm.contract.safe_ainvoke`, :func:`app.llm.contract.safe_astream`,
or :func:`app.llm.contract.make_safe_chat_model`.

The check is intentionally textual-AST (not type-aware) because LangChain
chat models are not nominally typed. We rely on a *receiver allowlist*:
calls like ``self._graph.ainvoke(...)`` and ``investigation_graph.ainvoke(...)``
are LangGraph control-flow primitives, not LLM invocations, and are listed
explicitly so a reviewer notices when the allowlist grows.

To add a new permitted receiver name, append to ``_ALLOWED_RECEIVERS`` with
a short justification comment. To exempt an entire file (because the file
itself implements the wrapper), append to ``_ALLOWED_FILES``.
