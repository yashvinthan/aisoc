            The compliance problem with closed-source AI SOCs
          </h2>
          <p>
            Closed-source AI SOC products typically ask a regulated buyer to
            accept three things at once: incident data leaves the buyer
            network for inference in vendor cloud, the agent prompts and
            policy are not visible outside the vendor, and the accuracy
            numbers cannot be reproduced by the buyer or their auditor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third item is the one that compounds the other two. A number
            that the buyer cannot reproduce is hard to defend in a SOC 2,
            ISO 27001, or DORA review. In practice this often results in the
            AI SOC being deployed for non-regulated tenants and a manual
            triage queue being kept for regulated ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            AiSOC takes the opposite approach: the agent is in the repo, the
            substrate eval is a CI gate, data stays in the buyer network by
            default, and the MIT licence is permanent.

            What the licence does and does not allow
          </h2>
          <p>
            Open source is overloaded as a term. AiSOC ships under MIT with no
            CLA, and the project commitment is to keep the core under MIT.
            What that means in practice:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-3">
            <li className="rounded-lg border border-white/5 bg-white/[0.02] p-4">
              <span className="font-semibold text-gray-200">No CLA.</span>{' '}
              Contributors keep copyright on their patches. The project does
              not collect an irrevocable licence to relicense under SSPL,
              BSL, or a proprietary EULA at a later date.
            </li>
            <li className="rounded-lg border border-white/5 bg-white/[0.02] p-4">
              <span className="font-semibold text-gray-200">No telemetry.</span>{' '}
              Self-hosted deployments emit no analytics back to the project.
              The only network calls AiSOC initiates are the ones the
              operator configured (LLM provider, threat intelligence feed,
              integrations).
            </li>
            <li className="rounded-lg border border-white/5 bg-white/[0.02] p-4">
              <span className="font-semibold text-gray-200">
                The agent is in the open repo.
              </span>{' '}
              The orchestrator, planner, prompt templates, tool registry,
              response policy, and rubric — the components that reason over
              incident data — are in this repo. There is no separate
              enterprise agent.

              is explicit about which metrics measure real substrate
              behaviour (alert reduction) and which are substrate
              self-consistency gates (MITRE tactic, completeness, response
              quality). The relevant property is that the harness exists and
              is reproducible, not that any specific number beats a vendor
              claim.

              The agent sends prompts to whichever LLM endpoint is
              configured. The Investigation Ledger logs every prompt, so
              what leaves the network is auditable, but the trust boundary
              is the configured LLM provider, not AiSOC. A future
              local-inference mode is on the roadmap.
