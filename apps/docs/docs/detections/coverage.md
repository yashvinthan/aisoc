description: |
  AiSOC v1.0 ships a curated set of MITRE ATT&CK-mapped
  detections covering the eight buyer-prioritised threat
  families. This page is generated from the on-disk corpus
  via ``scripts/curate_detections.py`` — it is the source
  of truth for what we promise in v1.0.

## How to audit

The curated rule IDs are listed in [`marketplace/curated.json`](https://github.com/aisoc-platform/aisoc/blob/main/marketplace/curated.json) under each family. Every entry has a `path` field pointing at the on-disk YAML. Run `pnpm marketplace:curate --check` in CI to enforce drift; run `python3 scripts/curate_detections.py` locally to regenerate.
