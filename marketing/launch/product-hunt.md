## Description (≤ 260 chars)

```
AiSOC is an open-source, self-hostable AI security operations center. Triage a
batch of alerts to verdicts in 60s with `npx aisoc triage --demo` — no key, no
Docker. Every agent decision is logged and replayable. MIT-licensed: read,
fork, or replace the agent.
```

## Maker's first comment

```
Hey PH 👋

I built AiSOC because "AI SOC" products are all closed boxes — you can't see
why the agent made a call, and you can't run the evals yourself.

AiSOC is the opposite:
• `npx aisoc triage --demo` gives you a verdict on 200 alerts in under a second,
  deterministic, no key, no install.
• Every agent step (prompt, tool call, evidence, rationale) is stored in an
  Investigation Ledger and replayable — you can even publish a redacted replay
  as a public link.
• A public eval harness gates every PR, and it's honest about what's a real
  measurement vs. a synthetic self-consistency check.
• Free browser tools (rule translator, ATT&CK coverage grader) with no login.

It's MIT-licensed and self-hostable — your data never leaves your perimeter
(hosted-LLM evidence is pseudonymized by default; a local-model path is fully
air-gapped).

Would love feedback from anyone running a SOC. What would make you trust an
open agent over a closed one?
