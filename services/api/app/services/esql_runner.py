"""Background-friendly ES|QL executor — Track 3, T3.4 (`/hunt` NL surface).

This module exposes a single async helper, :func:`run_esql_query`, that
both the request-scoped ``/nl-query/execute`` endpoint and the
out-of-band saved-hunt scheduler can call to run an ES|QL query against
the configured Elasticsearch backend.

Why a shared helper instead of inlining the call?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before T3.4 the ES|QL HTTP call lived inside
``services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/nl_query.py`` and depended on a
``QueryResult`` Pydantic model + FastAPI request scope. The saved-hunt
scheduler (``app/workers/hunt_scheduler.py``) is an asyncio worker
launched from the FastAPI ``lifespan`` hook — it has no request scope
and is *deliberately* free of FastAPI imports so it can be lifted into a
separate sidecar later. The scheduler therefore could not reuse the
endpoint's executor directly, and shipped a stub that always returned
zero hits (see the historical `_execute_hunt` TODO in
``hunt_scheduler.py``).

This module is the lift: a tiny dataclass + plain async function that
takes the URL, API key, and ES|QL string and returns
``(columns, rows, took_ms)``. The endpoint wraps the result back into
its Pydantic ``QueryResult`` shape; the scheduler reads ``len(rows)``
and feeds that into its case-open callback.

Security invariants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **SSRF guard.** :func:`run_esql_query` calls
  :func:`_validate_es_url` to enforce that the target host matches the
  configured ``ES_URL`` / ``ELASTICSEARCH_URL`` / ``OPENSEARCH_URL``
  setting. A mismatched host raises :class:`ValueError` *before* any
  outbound request leaves the process.
* **Air-gap policy.** Each call routes the final URL through
  :func:`enforce_airgap_for_url` so an operator who flipped
  ``AISOC_AIRGAPPED=true`` can't accidentally leak a query to a
  public host.
* **No new dependencies.** Uses ``httpx`` (already a hard dep of the
  API service) for the outbound call.

Test coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See ``tests/test_esql_runner.py`` for the dedicated unit tests, and
``tests/test_saved_hunts_endpoint.py`` for the scheduler integration
test that wires ``_execute_hunt`` through this helper.
