"""Investigation Ledger — the step-by-step record of one investigation run.

The shape here mirrors the production `investigation_events` ledger
written by [`services/agents/`](https://github.com/aisoc/aisoc/tree/main/services/agents)
so that an analyst who learns the sandbox can read a real ledger
without re-learning the schema. Differences from production:

  * No persistence. The ledger lives in memory for the duration of
    one CLI invocation; the production ledger writes to Postgres.
  * No prompt/response capture. The sandbox uses a deterministic stub
    in place of the real LLM, so `prompt` / `response` fields hold a
    short descriptor of the decision rather than the full LLM text.
  * No tool dispatch. Tool calls are simulated as
    "would-call(<name>, <args>)" entries so the funnel still reads
    naturally without spinning up the connector / action stack.

    """One step in the investigation funnel.

    Attributes:
        step: 0-indexed step number across the whole run.
        agent: Which of the four production agents emitted this step.
            One of: `DetectAgent`, `TriageAgent`, `HuntAgent`,
            `RespondAgent`, or `Orchestrator` (the funnel wrapper).
        funnel_stage: The four-stage automation maturity funnel:
            `detect | triage | hunt | respond`.
        action: A human-readable verb (e.g. "Correlate authentication
            events", "Compute confidence band", "Recommend response").
        rationale: One sentence summarising why the agent did this.
        evidence: Key/value evidence chips. Maps to the production
            Investigation Rail's "Related entities" panel.
        tool_calls: Tools the agent would invoke (sandboxed; not
            executed). Each entry is `{"name": ..., "args": {...}}`.
        decision: Optional summary of the step's outcome — confidence
            band, recommended action, or routing decision.
        latency_ms: Wall-clock duration of the step inside the
            simulator. Production ledger captures real LLM latency;
            the sandbox uses synthetic deterministic numbers.
        timestamp_utc: ISO-8601 timestamp at step emission.
