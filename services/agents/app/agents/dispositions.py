"""Canonical triage disposition taxonomy + normalization layer (#526).

The auto-triage LLM and the deterministic fallback scorer historically spoke
different dialects (``benign`` / ``false_positive`` vs. ``likely_benign`` /
``needs_review`` / ``confirmed_incident``). This module is the single
normalization layer that reconciles them, and it introduces an explicit
``benign_true_positive`` outcome.

The taxonomy separates two *independent* questions:

* **Detection validity** — did the rule correctly detect its intended
  condition?
* **Activity maliciousness** — was the detected activity an actual threat?

  - ``true_positive``        valid detection of malicious / unauthorized
                             activity.
  - ``benign_true_positive`` valid detection of AUTHORIZED, expected, or
                             non-malicious activity (an approved penetration
                             test, a scheduled vulnerability scan, sanctioned
                             admin tooling). The rule was CORRECT, so this must
                             NOT be recorded as a false positive — doing so
                             corrupts per-rule false-positive-rate metrics and
                             unfairly penalizes good detections.
  - ``false_positive``       invalid / noisy detection; the intended condition
                             was not actually present.
  - ``benign``               real but non-threatening activity that is not a
                             detection-validity statement (informational).
                             Retained for backward compatibility — see the
                             migration note below.
  - ``needs_review``         insufficient evidence to decide safely; route to a
                             human / the full pipeline.
  - ``escalate``             analyst-forced escalation.

Compatibility / migration
--------------------------
Existing ``benign`` records remain valid and are intentionally left untouched:
``benign`` and ``benign_true_positive`` are *distinct* outcomes (the former
makes no claim about detection validity), so no data backfill is required.
Consumers that compute false-positive rate already key on the literal
``false_positive`` string, so ``benign_true_positive`` is naturally excluded
from FP metrics and kept separate on dashboards, filters, and exports.
