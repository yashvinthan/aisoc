"""Keep ``services/api/app/_vendor/narrative.py`` in lockstep with its source.

The correlation-narrative builder lives canonically under
``services/fusion/app/services/narrative.py`` and is consumed by both the
fusion service (at fusion time, to populate ``FusedAlert.narrative``) and the
API service (lazily, when a row's ``narrative`` column is ``NULL``). Because
the ``aisoc-api`` Docker image is built with ``services/api`` as its build
context, anything under ``services/fusion`` is not available at runtime. To
keep the API container self-contained we ship a vendored mirror of
``narrative.py`` inside the API package.

Run modes
---------
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_narrative.py``           — copy source → vendored.
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_narrative.py --check``   — fail (exit 1) if the
  vendored file is missing or differs from the source. CI uses this mode.

The script is intentionally tiny and dependency-free so it can run in any CI
runner.
