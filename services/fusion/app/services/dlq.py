"""Dead-letter queue for the fusion consumer (Phase 5).

A poison message — malformed JSON shape, an unknown schema version, a non-UUID
tenant, or a RawAlert that fails deep validation — must not crash the consumer
and must not vanish. Before Phase 5 the consumer logged a warning and dropped
it (silent data loss the reality audit flagged). Now every such message is
routed here: captured with its reason, schema version, source-event lineage,
and a truncated copy of the payload, so an operator can see exactly what was
rejected and why.

Sinks are pluggable and **fail-soft** — a DLQ that itself throws must never
take down the consumer (that would turn a single poison message into an
outage). :func:`safe_record` wraps every sink call.

* :class:`LoggingDLQ` — default. Emits a structured ``fusion.dead_letter``
  warning. Always available, zero dependencies.
* :class:`InMemoryDLQ` — test double; keeps records in a list.
* :class:`KafkaDLQ` — production option that republishes to a dead-letter
  topic (``aisoc.alerts.dlq``) via the consumer's existing producer, so DLQ
  volume is observable on the same bus as everything else.
