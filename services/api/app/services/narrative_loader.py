"""Dynamic loader for the correlation-narrative builder.

The narrative builder lives canonically in
``services/fusion/app/services/narrative.py`` and is consumed by both:

* the **fusion service**, at fusion time, to populate
  ``FusedAlert.narrative`` deterministically before publishing the alert to
  Kafka; and
* the **API service**, lazily, when ``GET /alerts/{id}`` is asked for an
  alert whose ``narrative`` column is still ``NULL`` (e.g. legacy rows that
  were fused before the column existed).

Because the ``aisoc-api`` Docker image is built with ``services/api`` as its
build context, anything under ``services/fusion`` is **not** available at
runtime. ``scripts/sync_vendored_narrative.py`` byte-mirrors the source file
into ``services/api/app/_vendor/narrative.py``; CI fails the build if the two
files drift.

This module loads that vendored file under a collision-free name
(``aisoc_fusion_narrative``) so it does not interfere with anything else in
the ``app`` package. It also falls back to the source-of-truth file at
``services/fusion/app/services/narrative.py`` for local development where
the API runs outside of Docker against a checked-out monorepo.

Public re-exports (one-to-one with ``narrative.py``):

* :data:`build_narrative` — pure function ``(NarrativeInputs) -> str``.
* :class:`NarrativeInputs` — dataclass of all builder inputs.
* :class:`NarrativeFactor` — single confidence-factor entry inside
  ``NarrativeInputs.confidence_factors``.

Determinism guarantee
---------------------
``build_narrative`` is a pure, deterministic function. Calling it twice with
the same ``NarrativeInputs`` returns the same byte-for-byte string. The
caller (the alerts endpoint) safely persists the result on the row so we
only pay the build cost once per alert.
