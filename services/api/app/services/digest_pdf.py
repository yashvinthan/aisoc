"""WS-G2 — Server-side PDF generation for the Executive Weekly Digest.

Uses WeasyPrint to convert the print-ready HTML produced by
``digest_html.render_digest_html`` into a PDF byte stream.

WeasyPrint requires native libs (Pango, Cairo, GLib) that are installed in the
Docker image via ``apt-get``.  When those libs are absent (e.g. CI or a macOS
dev machine without the native stack) we fall back gracefully so that
non-PDF code paths remain functional.
